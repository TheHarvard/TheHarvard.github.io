<pre>
The Keller & Phillip Compact Magnetic Rifle mark 3 (KP-CMR3) is a semiautomatic
magnetic rifle platform developed by Keller & Phillip in 3204.
It superseded the KP-CMR2 platform.

Based on earlier K&P designs for vehicle mounted electromagnetic mass driver
(KP-EMD) systems, the Compact Magnetic Rifle family is a miniaturized, hand
operated version of the same technology.
The largest difference is that the CMR3 uses IP cartridges with an integrated
power source per cartridge, while the EDM systems are powered by dedicated
power systems, and shoot "dumb" mass projectiles.

The KP-CMR3, like the KP-CMR2, operates by accelerating a ferrous projectile
along two conducting rails using a high electric current shorted over the
projectile and between the rails.
Due to the high weight of the conductive rails and power management system, and
due to the high recoil of the rifle, the KP-CMR3 is typically not outfitted with
burst or fully-automatic fire modes.

Ammunition

The KP-CMR3's standard configuration is the IP-12/42 cartridge (Integrated
Power 12 gram 4200 joules), but several variations exists.

The IP cartridge standard is an interplanetary standard for electric rifle
ammunition with integrated power sources, developed and first published in 
3198.
The inclusion of a integrated power source with each cartridge means that
weapons using IP ammunition does not need additional power sources like power-
cells or wired connections.
The need to make a IP compatible variant of the KP-CMR2 was one of the driving
forces behind the development of the KP-CMR3 platform.

The IP-12/42 cartridge contains a soft-core flechette projectile in the top of
the cartridge, and an crystalline electro-chemical generator in the bottom of
the cartridge. When loaded into a IP compatible electric rifle, the generator
is connected to the rails via contact pads on the cartridge, and it is activated
by an electric pulse from the trigger mechanism.

Several variants of IP-12/42 have been developed since the platforms release in
3204, and are now commonly used to augment the characteristics of the rifle.

The IP-12/42-AP is an armour penetrating variant of the IP-12/42, and has
a ultra dense flechette carried on a discarding coil sabot, enabling it to
reach a higher muzzle velocity and better penetrate armour.
As an armour penetrating round, the IP-12/42-AP is often at risk of over-
penetrating softer targets.
It uses the same electro-chemical generator as the IP-12/42, but with a
slightly adjusted ramp characteristic.

The IP-12/82-P replaces the flechette projectile of the IP-12/42 with a pellet
mixture and uses a significantly larger electro-chemical generator to partially
melt and ignite the projectile as it is accelerated along the rails.
While its efficacy drops significantly over distance, it is able to deliver a
large stopping force and secondary heat shock over shorter ranges.
It is often used to breech doors or locks.
Due to the larger generator and added thermal output, the IP-12/82-P is not
compatible with burst or automatic fire, and not available as belted ammunition.

Notable uses

- Keller & Phillip employs the KP-CMR3 for use by it's own corporate security
  Forces.

- The KP-CMR3 was widely used by AURORA Media corporation operatives during the 
  AREZ Redaction Crisis.

- A customized variant of the KP-CMR3 platform was officially adopted by the
  Megeno Planetary Security Force (MPSF) in 3206.

- In the action movie series Dead Glare, the heroin Jane Destiny, played by 
  Nena Lowitzer, uses Keller & Phillips weapons throughout the plot.
  In particular, her named rifle from the 2nd movie of the series, "Big Johnny",
  is a belt fed KP-CMR3-A variant used without its mounting hardware.

- In the 3rd movie of the series "DEAD GLARE: OPERATION STYX", Jane Destiny
  uses the then recently launched IP-12/82-P cartridge to fight her way through
  the jungles of Astynar in the Bansulo system.
  The movie have several inaccuracies surrounding the use of the cartridge,
  particularly its effective range and volume of fire have been overstated, and
  the movie shows the IP-12/82-P cartridge on belt, which is not offered by K&P.

________________________________________________________________________________

> KP-CMR3-A

The -A upgrade package adds the necessary cooling systems and 
vehicle mounting hardware to make the KP-CMR3 operate as a burst fire,
anti personnel rifle.
Due to it's high weight and recoil, the KP-CMR3-A is usually only deployed as
a static- or vehicle mounted installation.

Fire mode:         Semi-automatic, 3 round Burst*

________________________________________________________________________________

> KP-CMR3-M

The KP-CMR3-M variation of the KP-CMR3 was developed custom for the Megeno
Planetary Security Force (MPSF) in 3206 to resist the particularly harsh
environmental conditions of Megeno.
The gun is fully sealed and uses a custom tube magazine and barrel shutter
to prevent any atmospheric ingress.

> KP-CMR3-LR

The -LR variant of the KP-CMR3 have significantly longer rails, and is 
configured to able to fire the higher power IP-38/208 projectiles. Due to the
increased weight of the rails and cartridges the -LR variant have no self -
loading capabilities, and is configured with a bolt action.
It is usually deployed in long range (sniper) or anti-material roles.

Fire mode:         Bolt action 
Cartridge:         IP-38/208
Effective range:   1000 meters
Maximum range:     2000 meters
Attack modifier:   +0
