<h1>List of Imperial Emperoxes</h1>

<pre>The imperial emperoxes were rulers who governed the sector as parts of the 
Imperial Mandate since its formation during the first wave of colonization.</pre>

<h2>List inclusion criteria</h2>

<pre>This list aims to give an self consistent, conservative overview of the
very long and varied history of the regency of the imperial mandate.
To accomplice this goal some compromises have been required:

- During the first wave of colonization, only the Emperoxes directly 
  instated by the Imperial mandate on earth have been included.

- During the second wave, Interregnums have been listed for periods
  where no claimant to the imperial throne were able to secure sector wide
  recognition.

- During the silence, only claimants with de facto control of the imperial throne
  Have been included. Several Anti-Emperoxes have been omitted.
