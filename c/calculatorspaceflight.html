Game mechanics from SWN:
- Spike Drills costs 1 unit of fuel @ 1000 Credits independent of ship size
- A standard ship can only hold 1 unit, 2 if configured with some expense
- Fuel must be bought, unless ship is configured to harvest at some expense
- All spike drills take 1 unit of fuel, but take 6 days * hex / drive rating
- Sublight/intrasystem travel takes negligible amounts of fuel
- Sublight/intrasystem travel takes "a few days at most":
-- across a region, 6 hours
-- between any region, 48 hours
-- travel time is divided by Drive rating (1-6+)

Implemented mechanics
- Needed fuel (and cost) scales linearly with ship mass.
- Fuel can be hydrogen, or collected water ran through electrolyzer.
- Intrasystem travel consumes significant fuel.
- Intrasystem travel times are based on 1g constant acceleration.
- Distinction between space engines, and atmospheric engines
-- Flying in atmosphere is much much less efficient for an engaging range


Benefits of these assumptions and this framework:
- A given distance always takes the same amount of time, and fuel fraction.
- Constant acceleration profile is more intuitive that orbital mechanics.
- Higher acceleration and efficiency feels intuitive as well.

Makes sci-fi space travel aproachable by lay people used to driving
cars, and not dealing with orbital mechanics.


Examples:

- Earth to moon ~0.003AU
- Mars closest ~ 0.5AU
- Jupiters orbit R ~ 5AU
- Saturns orbit R ~ 10AU
- Uranus orbit R ~ 20AU
- Neptunes orbit R ~ 30AU



Constant acceleration calculator:
This assumed flight paths that accelerate for half the journey,
and slow down for the other half to both start and end at rest.

- A - Constant acceleration m/s/s
- V - Exhaust velocity m/s
- F - Fuel fraction of total mass %
- D - Distance m
- T - Time s

Calculating distance from fuel fraction:
D = (V^2/4*A) * ln(1/(1-F))^2

Calculating required fuel fraction for a given distance:
F = 1-e^ (-(2*sqrt(A*D)/V))

Calculate Time from Distance:
T = 2*sqrt(D/A)

Calculate Distance from Time:
D = (A*T^2)/4







Missing:

Get the proportion of distance travelled at T time:
D_proportion(T) = 

Get the ship speed at specific time in journey:
Speed(T) = 

Get the top speed at half the journey:
Speed_max = 


Missing:
- Energy needed to hover (about 1g near planet)
- Energy needed to match orbits (negligible)
- time to switch between hover and orbit. 15 min ish
- time to take off and land on planet surface. 3min ish







Current effective range considering
- Max safe acceleration
- Min safe acceleration
- Max safe deacceleration
- Min safe deacceleration
- Current remaining time (limited by food, or custom limit)
- Engine exhaust velocity
- Current fuel mass fraction

How far can the vessel get in the specified time,
without breaking acceleration limits. (spend longest time at high speed)












Shorthand table

C = 0.002004 AU / S
1 AU in 499 Seconds or 8.32 minutes


Distance        - 0.002AU - 0.1AU - 1AU - 2AU - 40 AU
Light delay     -                   499s

Atmospheric flights

Breguet range equation 
Range = Lift/Drag * speed/fuelConsumption * ln(W_initial/Weight_final)
Range ∝ Speed/FuelEfficiencyTerm * ln(1/1-FuelMassFraction)
Assume constant speed

Car range:
Range ∝ FuelWeight / (VehicleWeight+FuelWeight * Speed * speed)
Assume constant speed






Habitable zone and solar power per square meter

Star types, luminocity (relative to sun)
M 0.0001-0.08
K 0.08-0.4
G 0.6-1.6

Suns luminocity 3.828 E^26 W
Earth solar flux 1361 W/m^2


Habitable zone for sunlike stars: 0.95AU (ocean evaporation) to 1.67AU (CO2 condensation)

Stellar output
Stellar power relative to distance

Stellar flux = Luminocity / 4 * pi * Distance^2 
decides:
- Planet habitability
- Equilibrium temperature of ships
- Available power

Stellar flux, Hotter habitable limit ~ 1500 to 1600
Stellar flux, Colder habitable limit ~ 475 - 490
Stellar flux, 



Converting solar flux to equilibrum temperature
(assuming uniform sphere)

(Flux - AlbedoReflectedFluxFraction) / (4 * Emissivity * SB_Constant)


Thermal time constant - 63.2% (aka 1/e)
It takes the same time for temeprature to 


Thermal conductivity =  Conductivity * TempDelta
Radiation "conductivity" =  Conductivity * TempDelta
