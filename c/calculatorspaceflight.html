Game mechanics from SWN:
- Spike Drills costs 1 unit of fuel @ 1000 Credits independent of ship size
- A standard ship can only hold 1 unit, 2 if configured with some expense
- Fuel must be bought, unless ship is configured to harvest at some expense
- All spike drills take 1 unit of fuel, but take 6 days * hex / drive rating
- Sublight/intrasystem travel takes negligible amounts of fuel
- Sublight/intrasystem travel takes "a few days at most":
-- across a region, 6 hours
-- between any region, 48 hours
-- travel time is divided by Drive rating (1-6+)

Implemented mechanics
- Needed fuel (and cost) scales linearly with ship mass.
- Fuel can be hydrogen, or collected water ran through electrolyzer.
- Intrasystem travel consumes significant fuel.
- Intrasystem travel times are based on 1g constant acceleration.
- Distinction between space engines, and atmospheric engines
-- Flying in atmosphere is much much less efficient for an engaging range


Benefits of these assumptions and this framework:
- A given distance always takes the same amount of time, and fuel fraction.
- Constant acceleration profile is more intuitive that orbital mechanics.
- Higher acceleration and efficiency feels intuitive as well.

Makes sci-fi space travel aproachable by lay people used to driving
cars, and not dealing with orbital mechanics.


Examples:

- Earth to moon ~0.003AU
- Mars closest ~ 0.5AU
- Jupiters orbit R ~ 5AU
- Saturns orbit R ~ 10AU
- Uranus orbit R ~ 20AU
- Neptunes orbit R ~ 30AU



Constant acceleration calculator:
This assumed flight paths that accelerate for half the journey,
and slow down for the other half to both start and end at rest.

- A - Constant acceleration m/s/s
- V - Exhaust velocity m/s
- F - Fuel fraction of total mass %
- D - Distance m
- T - Time s

Calculating distance from fuel fraction:
D = (V^2/4*A) * ln(1/(1-F))^2

Calculating required fuel fraction for a given distance:
F = 1-e^ (-(2*sqrt(A*D)/V))

Calculate Time from Distance:
T = 2*sqrt(D/A)

Calculate Distance from Time:
D = (A*T^2)/4







Missing:

Get the proportion of distance travelled at T time:
D_proportion(T) = 

Get the ship speed at specific time in journey:
Speed(T) = 

Get the top speed at half the journey:
Speed_max = 


Missing:
- Energy needed to hover (about 1g near planet)
- Energy needed to match orbits (negligible)
- time to switch between hover and orbit. 15 min ish
- time to take off and land on planet surface. 3min ish



Atmospheric flights

Breguet range equation 
Range = Lift/Drag * speed/fuelConsumption * ln(W_initial/Weight_final)
Range ∝ Speed/FuelEfficiencyTerm * ln(1/1-FuelMassFraction)
Assume constant speed

Car range:
Range ∝ FuelWeight / (VehicleWeight+FuelWeight * Speed * speed)
Assume constant speed
