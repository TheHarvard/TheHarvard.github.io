<p>This page is for testing the different colourways available.</p> 
<p>Available colourways ordered by the authors preference:</p>   

<!-- Buttons to select stylesheet -->
<pre>
<button onclick="setColourway('../css/colourwayAmber.css')">[ Amber ]</button> is the default colourway. It's classy, mellow, corporate and very pleasant.

<button onclick="setColourway('../css/colourwayGreen.css')">[ Green ]</button> is a another classic colourway, more suited for a "techno" look.

<button onclick="setColourway('../css/colourwayCyan.css')">[ Cyan ]</button> was a suprise for me. it has good clarity, and a cool and carefree feel.

<button onclick="setColourway('../css/colourwayPurple.css')">[ Purple ]</button> is a a great mystical colourway. Feels perfectly alien and wierd.

<button onclick="setColourway('../css/colourwayRed.css')">[ Red ]</button> is the typical evil empire look. might be a bit much though.

<button onclick="setColourway('../css/colourwayBlue.css')">[ Blue ]</button> is tricky. clarity is not super, but it does look very peacefull.

<button onclick="setColourway('../css/colourwayWhite.css')">[ White ]</button> is a bit uncanny... It has potential as a lab- or sterile look.
