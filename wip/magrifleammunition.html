<h>Keller & Phillip KP-CMR3</h>

<pre>
The Keller & Phillip Compact Magnetic Rifle mark 3 (KP-CMR3) is a semiautomatic
magnetic rifle platform developed by Keller & Phillip in 3204.
It superseded the KP-CMR2 platform.

Based on earlier K&P designs for vehicle mounted electromagnetic mass driver
(KP-EMD) systems, the Compact Magnetic Rifle family is a miniaturized, hand
operated version of the same technology.
The largest difference is that the CMR uses IP cartridges with integrated
power sources per cartridge, while the EDM system are powered by dedicated
power systems, and shoot "dumb" projectiles.

The KP-CMR3 operates by accelerating a ferrous projectile along two conducting
rails using a high electric current shorted over the projectile and between the
rails.
Due to the high weight of the conductive rails and power management system, and
the high recoil of the rifle, the KP-CMR3 is typically not outfitted with full
automatic fire modes.

Ammunition

The KP-CMR3's standard configuration is IP-12/42 (Integrated Projectile
12 gram 4200 joules), but several variations exists.

The IP cartridge standard is an interplanetary standard for electric rifle
ammunition with integrated power sources.
This means that weapons using IP ammunition does not need additional power
sources like power cells or wired connections.

The IP-12/42 cartridge have some variants available:

The IP-12/42-F replaces the soft core projectile of the IP-12/42 with an
expanding flechette. Once free of the rails the flechette expands into a
projectile larger than the diameter of the rails.

The IP-12/42-AP is an armour penetrating variant of the IP-12/42, and has
a hardened projectile able to better penetrate armour.

The IP-8/82-P uses a significantly larger power source to partially melt the
projectile as it is accelerated along the rails.

> KP-CMR3-A

The -A upgrade package adds the necessary cooling systems and 
vehicle mounting hardware to make the KP-CMR3 operate as a burst fire,
anti personnel rifle.
Due to it's high weight and recoil, the KP-CMR3-A is usually only deployed as
a static- or vehicle mounted installation.

Fire mode:         Semiautomatic, 3 round Burst*
Cartridge:          IP-12/42,           IP-12/42-AP,        IP-8/82-P
Effective range:      300 meters        | 300 meters        |  20 meters
Maximum range:        600 meters        | 600 meters        |  40 meters
Attack modifier:      +0         (+2)*  | +1         (+3)*  |  +0        (+2)*  
Damage:               2d8+2   (2d8+4)*  | 1d10   (1d10+2)*  |  3d8    (3d8+2)*  
Feed system:        8- 10- and 12 round detachable box magazine,
                    40 round polymer belt box (Encumbrance +2)
Encumbrance:       3


________________________________________________________________________________
> KP-CMR3-LR

The -LR variant of the KP-CMR3 have significantly longer rails, and is 
configured to able to fire the higher power IP-38/208 projectiles. Due to the
increased weight of the rails and cartridges the -LR variant have no self -
loading capabilities, and is configured with a bolt action.
It is usually deployed in long range (sniper) or anti material roles.

Effective range:    1000 meters
Maximum range:      2000 meters
Attack modifier:    +0
Damage:             2d8+4
Encumbrance:        2
Cartridge:          IP-38/208
Fire mode:          Bolt action 
Feed system:        Single shot
