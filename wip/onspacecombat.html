    Chapter 3 - On Thrust and fuel

In real space all matter is bound by the newtonian principles of action and
reaction. As we, and the ships we fly, are made of matter; we too are bound
by these limits.
This means that to be able to move anything in space at all we need to push off
off some other mass, aka a reaction mass.
The harder we push against a reaction mass, the harder it pushes back, and
the more speed we can gain from the same reaction mass.

It does not fundamentally matter what we push off off, but in most modern 
spaceship we push off the exhaust products from the spike core.
As these particles come directly from the spike core, they are already
carrying a lot of energy and traveling at high speeds.
In addition to the exhaust products from the spike core itself, most modern
engine systems also allows for the spike core coolant to be expelled to rapidly
cool the spike core and give a significant burst of thrust.

As the spike core is fueled by hydrogen (H2), and every crew needs water (H2O)
and oxygen (O2) for life support, it is useful to be aware of the relationship
between these 3 substances:

    Hydrogen (H2)                                                               
      - Fuels the spike core.                                                   
      - Can be burned with oxygen (O2) in a               2 Water               
        fuel cell to generate electricity.                 (2H2O)               
      - Can be cracked from ice/water.                       / \                
      - Occurs naturally near stars or gas giants.          /   \               
                                                           /     \              
    Oxygen (O2)                                           /       \             
      - Essential for life support.                      /         \            
      - Can be burned with hydrogen (H2) in a           /           \           
        fuel cell to generate electricity.        4 Hydrogen     2 Oxygen       
      - Can be cracked from ice/water.              (2 H2)         (O2)         
      - Rarely easily available in space.                                       
                                                                                
    Water (H2O)
      - Essential for life support.
      - Common coolant and reaction mass for the spike core.
      - Sometimes used as radiation shielding.
      - Is produced by burning Hydrogen (H2) Oxygen (O2) in a fuel cell.
      - Occurs naturally in asteroid fields, and outer systems.

In an emergency a captain might need to manage his stores of hydrogen, oxygen
water and power.

    Chapter 4 - On Space Ship Combat

Spaceships come in all manner of shapes, sizes and intended purposes.
Some are meant for trade; the sustenance of civilization,
others are meant for research and exploration; that most noble of pursuits.
Others still are meant for recreation, racing, protection, communication, 
postal, maintenance, and a whole consort of other purposes.
But, unfortunately for these ships, there are also a great number of space ships
build specifically for the the purpose of violence.

The power of violence, used by itself or indirectly through coercions, is and
has always been at the very foundation of civilization.

This chapter will discuss how space ships are equipped, and should behave to
navigate the world of violence.

    4.1 - Defensive Countermeasures

Most every modern ship is powered by a spike core, and the runaway and eventual
supernova of the spike core remains the most common mode for sudden catastrophic
failure experienced by them.

In most cases, this will be caused either by severe equipment failures,
sabotage, or hostile action, though it is also sometimes caused by the
deliberate scuttling of a ship by its crew.
Logically then, the spike core is the most important parts of a ship to
protect, followed by essential systems like life support, heat management,
and her crew.


This can be expressed as the "Hierarchy of Protection":

    4. The spike core.

    3. The systems essential for continued life.

    2. The crew of the ship.

    1. Other systems.


Most defense architecture approach the Hierarch of Protection by layering it's
design to the same hierarchy.
Typically, the first layer is the active systems designed to neutralize hostile
arms before they can make it to the ship itself. This includes flares, chaff
reactive armour, defensive anti-missile lasers, hard-kill countermeasures, etc.

While these systems sometimes can prevent any harm to the ship itself by
disrupting the efficacy of the weapons levied against it, they are usually
single time use in nature, and as more are used up their degree of protection
will fall, exposing the next layer.

The second layer is the hull itself. Designed to keep the internal life support
internal, and the external hazards of space external, the hull is often equipped
with various kinds of ablative armour and reinforcing structures.
While resistant to attack, the hull of a spaceship usually includes some
natural weak points in features like airlocks, ports, windows and other 
perforations. Sustained heavy fire is usefully eventually successful at finding
these weak spots, and compromise  the hull.

The third layer is the mass of the ships internal structure, it's rooms,
frame, and non-essential systems, protecting the most important systems and
the cores final shielding; the fourth layer.
Once a the spike core shielding and regulator has been damaged, shutting down
the core can become incredibly hard if not impossible, resulting in a runaway
meltdown and singularity detonation.


To summarize the hierarchy:

    4. Inner spike core shielding.

    3. The non-essential rooms of the ship.

    2. Passive armour and ablative defenses.

    1. Reactive armour and hard-kill countermeasures.


All of these defensive measures are together often expressed as a simplified
"HP" score. The "HP" score system has been found to be an efficient way to
express a ships resilience, and to summarize the degree of damage sustained.
It is assumed that the last HP represent the inner core shielding, 
the last 1/4 of the HP represents the non-essential internal structure of the
ship, the first 1/4 of HP represents Reactive armour and hard kill defenses,
and the remaining 2/4 in between the two represents the hull.

A ships general resilience to harm is also often assigned a "armour" score.
Especially larger ships are able to field enough active and passive 
countermeasures that they are able to fully counter the efforts off smaller
weapons, without depleting the countermeasures.
This makes them effectively immune, or at least highly resistant to certain
non-armour penetrating arms.

    4.2 - Personal protection

In addition to the countermeasures build into the ship itself, a crew might
often have equipment and procedures to aid in their own individual survivability.

Breathing is the most important concern for keeping a crew alive. 
Without the ability to breath a average person will only be able to
remain conscious for around 15 seconds, and die within minutes.
Very little is separating our comfortable tube of oxygenated atmosphere from
the vast emptiness of outer space, and it usually does not take more than
a hole the size of a golf ball to be able to overload a decently sized 
life support system.
In a combat situation where decompression is likely, the crew should follow
practiced suit and helmet protocols, and be ready to seal-and-switch to
personal O2 supply before impacts.

Hard vacuum pose a unique mechanical threat to the human body. While less lethal
than suffocation, hard vacuum is able to severely damage and eventually kill a
human within tens of minutes. 
Hand held emergency respirators are not a long term alternative to a full
suit, but it will buy you whole minutes to save yourself or be saved.

Radiation can be quite common in space, as we do not have the protective
atmosphere and magnetic field of a planet. It can be encountered from
several sources; Shielding failure of the spike core, ambient radiation
depending on nearby stellar objects or as the result of hostile action.
While acutely deadly at high doses, radiation also pose a particular risks to
the long term health of the crew in the case of low level exposure. 
It is essential that the shielding systems of the ship are rated and maintained
for the ambient radiation where the ship will be traveling. 

Additionally, in the case of acute high level radiation exposure, it is
important that casualties be administered immediate interim care and brought
into advanced rad-rehab care as soon as possible.
Death can happen in less than 24 hours, and every hour without interim treatment
drastically reduces the chance of survival.

Temperature variations in space can be extreme.
In the case of equipment failure, a particularly hostile environment, or hostile
action, it is possible that temperatures might exceed that tolerated by humans.
Your suit is your friend, and your heat management system is your saviour.
Any captain that does not take the maintenance of his heat management system
seriously is putting his crew in immense danger.

Long term concerns like food, water and medicine are also important, but fall
outside the scop of this text.
