Ideas:

A modular system of elements to aid in TTRPG sci fi storytelling.

=== Screen Areas === 
- "The Globe": central circular interface, is a circular area with diameter
equal to the shortest dimention of the screen used to display navigational data.
Similar to a radar screen, but with various zoom levels and visualization
modes for different data.

- "The Wigdets": several clusters of display space used to display informations
like data on each player character, the parameters of the enviornment they are 
in, various controls etc.

    -- In each of the 4 corners of the circle, there is a space.

    -- Above and Below if screen is taller than wide and leaves open spaces
    above and below

    -- To the right and to the left if the screen is wider than tall, and the
    glove leaves open space to the sides.



=== Effects ===


=== Generation === 
- Based on a random static seed, and a number of parameters we should generate
a planetoid with:
-- Seas and landmasses
-- Moon-like highlands, low lands and craters
-- etc, based on the planetoid parameters


=== Calculations === 

- Location expressed in coordinates

- Standard time and Local time (sunrise/sunset etc)

- Day/Night/Eclipse calculations (and visualizations) based on
planetary parameters (rotation, orbit, distance from sun, moon/parent planet... etc)

- Fuel and range: depending on vehicle/travel parameters, a circle of range
is shown and travel can be planned and plotted with the circle shrinking
as fuel is consumed (should be general for foottravel, horseback, land vehicles
aircraft and missiles)

- Travelling and changes to coordinates

- timing and line of sight to various orbits. 

- Temperature (based on season, latitude, longditude and time, biome, and planetoid parameters)


=== Widgets ===

- Countdown to Next sunrise/sunset
- Countdown to line of sight between two orbiting sattelites, or a point on
the planetoid and a orbiting sattelite.
- Countdown to the distance between two points being closer than x
