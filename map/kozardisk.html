With over 94% of her surface covered in oceans, few easily accessible natural
resources, and only a microbial ecosystem, Kozardisk was never considered a
high priority for colonization during the early history of the sector.
Only once she won the bid for becoming an "imperial genetic engineering
quarantine world" did she get her first permanent settlements.

Based on recovered pre-scream records, the purpose of these first settlements
were to create the infrastructure needed to conduct Imperially sanctioned
genetics research and engineering projects in an environment where
contamination would be of low consequence.
Eventually, the decision was made to create seagoing cities and use the
myriad islands and atoll as terrestrial containment zones, and the now
famous city-vessels were commissioned.

While the number of cities reduced significantly during the scream and silence,
the floating cities of Kozardisk are still those same marvels of engineering
first commissioned during the Second Wave.

Following the scream, Kozardisk has been able to maintain much of the original
technology base used for genetic research, but are now operating under more
conservative ethical guidelines as the Kozardiskian ecosystem has grown into
a highly diverse and unique, engineered biosphere.
The intelligent squid are perhaps as famous as the floating cities, if not more.

Following the Wars of Sovereignty, Kozardis has been the first colony in the
sector to open a new Psionics Academy since the scream, reportedly based on 
imperial black budget R&D projects conducted during the war.
While controversial in the Imperial Senate, the Academy of Kozardis has
been granted the required Imperial licenses and security clearances to provide
healthcare, training, rehab and counseling for patients with Metadimensional
Extroversion Syndrome (MES).
