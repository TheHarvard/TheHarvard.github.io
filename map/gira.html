Gira is the first planet of the Pane system. Her surface is entirely covered by
several kilometers of water, and she does not host any icecaps.

Gira did not have any colonial settlements pre-scream self-sufficient enough
to survive the silence, nor does she host any significant permanent population
post-scream. Except for a large ecosystem of carbon based aquatic life forms,
Gira does not have any easily available resources.

In recent years, the diverse ecology of Gira have been of some interest
to corporate entities, and some viability projects are underway planetside.
