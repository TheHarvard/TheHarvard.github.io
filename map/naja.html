Once a hospitable planet in Ruti's goldilocks zone, Naja has at some
point in her recent past been ejected into a much wider orbit.

While her fields of frozen oxygen and nitrogen, and lakes of liquid
helium are of some industrial interest, lack of demand has prevented
any large scale industry from taking foot, and Naja is best known
for her resorts, retreats, casinos and entertainment facilities.

As a result of the AURORA-Ruti joint Entertainment Zone (AREZ), Naja
enjoys a high degree of corporate independence, and is the only planet
receiving live coverage of the "Alva-Verse". 

Naja also hosts the main offices of AURORA Media Group, and 
the population that is not part of the tourism sector
are nearly all AURORA media staff or executives.
