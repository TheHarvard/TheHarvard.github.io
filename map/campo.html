================================================================================

Campo is dominated by an incredibly thick and toxic atmosphere. 
Attempts to explore the surface have been largely unsuccessful
as intense atmospheric storms make remote exploration unfeasible,
and manned expeditions are generally considered suicidal.
What few manned missions have been attempted have not returned,
or have had to turn around before planetfall was made.

Recently uncovered pre-silence records indicate that campo 
did support a pre-scream colony, but it is unclear how and why
any permanent human settlement would ever be attempted.
