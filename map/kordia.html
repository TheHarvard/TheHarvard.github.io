Kordia is the seat of the Imperial Mandate and houses the Imperial Senate.
She is the second largest moon of Shakul.

Settled during the late First Wave, Kordia and her sister colony on Khanas
were the first colonies in the sector. As Kordias influence grew, 
Khanas was eventually absorbed and the United Shakul Management Body
(USMB) was created to manage the greater Shakul sphere of influence.

When the Imperial Mandate was first formed on Earth, Kordia was selected to 
be the sectors Imperial Authority, and later to host the Imperial Senate.
Unfit for mass urbanization, Kordia never grew her population to the size
of more densely populated worlds, but the centralization of imperial power
made here arguably the most important colony in the sector.

During the Scream and following Silence, the USMB, with help from Imperial
Mandate security forces, was able to keep the order on Kordia, and the smaller
population meant the supply issues felt so strongly by other world did not 
hit Kordia nearly as hard.

As the silence started to lift, Kordia was early to start the re-mapping efforts
and begins re-asserting itself as the Imperial Authority of the sector.
As worlds and systems were added back into the fold, the decision was made to
create an imperial senate to better represent each worlds interest without the
administrative insights from the imperial Administration on Earth.

Every world of every system were given one senator, and of each system one
senator was chosen to represent the whole of the system in matters of Imperial
Authority.

Following the death of Emperox Gelo the imperial senate elected Empress
Illia Desort, The black lioness, to the  imperial throne. Illia Desort chose
to govern much of her reign from Samida, physically seperate from the imperial
senate at Kordia, but during the Wars of Sovereignty the senate was evacuated
to Samida as well in response to the federation laying siege to Kordia.

Following the defeat of the Black Lioness at the hands of the federation,
the imperial senate of Samida was declared illegitimate, and the Kordian
Imperial Senate was restored, and Senatorial seats were given to the worlds
and systems of the federation in the hopes of avoiding another war.

Since the war, Kordia has focused on rebuilding her capitol of Pria,
Where the senate is hosted, and much of the planet is still depopulated, 
underdeveloped and contested by various groups.
