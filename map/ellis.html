A center of industry, Ellis has long served as the productivity
backbone of the local cluster. As a partial result of her long industrial
history, Ellis has experiences the buildup of highly toxic pollutants in
her atmosphere, which in turn has lead to widespread use of cybernetics
and a culture for body modification in her population.
Ellisian cybernetics are generally considered the most advanced 
and effective in the sector.

Some of the sectors largest, and oldest, shipyards are located on Ellis.
Due to it's industrial importance, Ellis has been declared
a demilitarized zone for the megacorporations, and the industry
of Ellis is fully managed from her moon Thorg, by whatever 
corporations are currently in favor.
