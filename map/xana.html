Pre-silence Xana was allocated as an imperial Penal colony. 
As a result of this purpose, Xana was set up to be much more 
self-sufficient than other comparable worlds, and therefore
suffered much less the shortages of the silence. 

From its very inception, the colony has been dedicated
to studying and improving the ecology of Xana, as she has
significant parts of her orbital period where the average
temperature drops significantly planet wide. These efforts
have lead to a lot of the agricultural innovations underpinning
Mefosian food supply, and the continued maintenance and engine-
ering of Xana's biosphere remains the great generational 
project of her inhabitants.

While there have been repeated talks about potential pardons
for the Xanacian people, and the details surrounding the formations
of the penal program have been largely lost following the dissolution
of the Xana Penal Administration some time during the silence,
they remain, technically, inmates of the Imperial Mandate.
