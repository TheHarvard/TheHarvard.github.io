Bizoglos is the largest moon of Calia, the 3rd planet of the Allisto system.

The population of Bizoglos is known for their particular biological adaptation.
Able to breath and process the highly corrosive and carcinogenic atmosphere
without significant health risk, the average Bizoglosian is also taller,
stronger, and shorter lived than the standard post-scream human gene reference.
They also seem to have, on average, a lower intelligence and a somewhat
higher rate of superstitious convictions, but it is difficult to account for
Bizoglos's particular social and cultural biases on this data.
Based on MES census data, Bizoglosians seem immune to the condition as no
case of a Bizoglosian with MES as been recorded, but due to Bizoglosian
underrepresentation in underlying data more research is needed.

Recently uncovered pre-scream records preliminarily seem to indicate that the
colonization of Bizoglos, and the existence of the unique biological
adaptations, pre-dates the scream and were imperially sanctioned.

Currently, Bizoglos is organized into a number of warring states, the largest
of which is the imperially recognized papal state of Bizoglos.
The theological authority of the Papacy of Bizoglos is widely recognized
in the wider sector, and holds an observer seat in the imperial senate.
Beyond the governing priest class, Bizoglos remains technologically primitive
post-scream.
