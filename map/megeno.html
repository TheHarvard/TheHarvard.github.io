Megeno has the coldest gaseous atmosphere on record. It is not
known what mechanism is preventing the atmosphere from freezing
into a solid form, but it is well known that if a suitable 
nucleation sites are provided, the supercooled atmosphere will
rapidly crash out of its gaseous phase and form into jagged,
steel hard deposits, known to be able to rip ships and suits apart.

Despite this, Megeno's close position to the spike lanes of an
otherwise sparse system has made it into a natural pit-stop for
travelers and spacers passing through the Maja system.

Using energy harvested from the phase change of the atmosphere,
Megenols have been able to sustain bubble cities that host 
breathable atmospheres and comfortable temperatures. 
Some Megenol bubble cities are also able to clear flight paths
though the atmosphere through cloud seeding, and maintain
state of the art flight control services to help ships
planetside for Majas most protected and secure markets.
