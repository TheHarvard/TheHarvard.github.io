Limero receives very little sunlight and would have been a dead
world if it was not for the tidal heating keeping it's atmosphere
from freezing in large "hot zones" around geothermal nodes.

Significant alien ruins can be found under the ice of Limero,
and it is theorized that the existence of a breathable atmosphere 
is at least in part due to artificial intervention in Limeros past.

Limeros population consists primarily of two demoninations;
religious refugees/pioneers, and corporate mining and research towns.
These settlements are usually dug in near geothermal hot zones and
make their living by mining and exporting raw materials like
chlorine ice, liquid oxygen, other elements and alien artifacts.
