Canomede is the 4th planet of the Creusa system.

It is best known for being the homeworld of the Canomedian Knights,
as well as for the barbarism of it's population.

During the scream the Canomedian society experience near total collapse.
As with many planets, the highly urbanized and populous Canomede was hit
with immediate shortages of food and medicine, but what few records exists
indicates that the local government disintegrated in mere days, as the
population responded by rapidly reverting to lawlessness, anarchy,
cannibalism and basest tribal survival.

The written record first starts to re-emerge when the initial purge has 
culled the planetary populating to a fraction of it's pre-scream levels,
and the tribal remnant starts forming a spiritualistic new order.
Over time, it seems like the forbearers to the modern Canomedian Knights
emerged as societal leaders, and society found a sort of unity in highly
structured rituals of bodily destruction still practiced today.

Canomede continues to be the subject of much societal study, but usually
only though review of what records have been found, or the rare insights
can be negotiated from the knights archives.
