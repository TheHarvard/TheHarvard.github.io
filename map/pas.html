Teetering at the very edge of the sphere of influence of it's
star, Pas is a remote ice-ball with a completely frozen surface.

Little is known about the ecology of Pas, but the existence of 
a planet-spanning, underground, liquid sea has been verified by 
early industry-viability probes.
While signs of carbon based life have been reported, no notable
efforts have been undertaken to mapping the biosphere beyond the
initial scans.

It is unknown what kind of mechanism is keeping the sea liquid,
though the most likely cause is the residual heat of a particularly
hot, and slow-cooling planetary core.

Pas currently do not host any human populations, though some remains
of orbital pre-scream presence has been found.
