Grimhil is the second planet of the Thorgun system.

Pre-Scream Grimhil was designated as a prime terraform candidate by the
Imperial Mandates Population Density and Management Initiative, and the
process of terraforming and colonizing her had been mostly completed by
the time the Scream happened, but Grimhil never underwent the necessary
stabilizing processes needed to prevent environmental relapse.

Currently Grimhil does not host any significant permanent settlements,
and she is undergoing a large flood basalt event covering 1/3 of her 
surface in basalt lava, as well as planet-wide geo-seismic turmoil.
