Shan is the innermost moon of Alldis.

With her harsh desert environment and large natural deposit of hydrocarbons,
Shan have always been a tough nut to crack for the Mefosian industrial
complex. Pre-Scream several large processing complexes were installed to
extract and refine the natural hydrocarbons into myriad useful polymers and 
chemicals, but during the Silence Mefosian efforts were pulled in favor of
supporting and feeding the population on Mefos herself.

In the absence of off-world governance, the local population rose to repurpose
the Mefosian infrastructure to crack water from oil, and extract the energy
needed to create functioning hydroponics in the desert heat.

From these limited resources rose the Sultanas; matriarchal warlords each
claiming a handful of refineries for their own dominions, and raising arms to
protect them.
Since the lifting of the silence, Mefos have been unable to regain full control
of her old colony. Having gone through several unsuccessful policies over the
years, Mefos is currently working towards re-integration through economic trade.
