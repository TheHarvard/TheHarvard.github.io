Sol is the first planet of the Thorgun system.

No pre-scream records indicate any colonization was ever attempted on Sol,
though they do note the curios occurrence of a largely breathable atmosphere
on a planet undergoing such vast volcanic activity.

Some human presence have been noted post-silence, but attempts to establish
contact have been largely unsuccessful. It seems that Sol have lost any
technological base they might have once had, and reverted to a very primitive
tribal society.
