Al-Owar is a dry, airless planet covered with rust-red regolith.
Despite this, Al-Owar has surprisingly robust micro-ecosystems.
Several, local instances of life have been observed across the barren
surface, some of which are able to host complex life and food chains.

Most efforts to colonize Al-Owar has been unsuccessful; the lack
of essential resources like water and metals have proved too much
for even the toughest pioneer willing to brave the airless and
scorching planet.

Several outposts have been registered to Al-Owar since post scream
records were first created, and while many of them have been  
verified as abandoned over the years, a few have been registered
as active over several census periods.
