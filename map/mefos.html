Mefos is the outmost colony of the Meris system, and the largest cultural
center and trading hub of the greater Merisian cluster.

Being one of the first colonies in the sector, Mefos was particularly suited
for mass urbanization and became an economic powerhouse of the early sector.
It is said that the greater Merisian cluster was built around Mefos, and this
would only be inaccurate in that most of the greater Merisian cluster was build
BY Mefos; through trade, infrastructure and investment.

Before the silence, Mefos were often at ods with the Imperial cluster to the
south. When Kordia won the bid to become the Imperial Authority of the sector,
Mefos found itself at the mercy of her rival. 
Despite the Imperial efforts to limit Mefosian influence in the Sector, Mefos
was able to leverage 

During the scream and silence, Mefos suffered great shortages and starvation,
but the planetary government was able to keep control, and ration resources.
Mefos were also able to mostly keep in contact with Herg, and establish
emergency trade networks to support her population.
Once the silence started lifting, and communication was re-established with
Kordia and the Imperial Cluster, Mefos demanded the formation of the Imperial
Senate to better represent the interests of the colonies as condition to
submitting herself to the Imperial Mandate.

Mefos is governed by the democratically elected Council of Chairmen and
Chairwomen "CCC", who influences much of the stellar neighborhood through 
foreign economic policies. Compared to the corporate economies of the eastern
Phio cluster, Mefos has always had a much more regulated economy, with large 
corporations usually being at least partially nationalized.

During the wars of Sovereignty, despite the CCC opposing the war and calling
for it's end, Mefos aligned themselves with the Imperial forces under Empress
Illia Desort. Once the Empress was defeated, Mefos hosted the peace conference
where the declaration of capitulation was signed.

Since the end of the war Mefosian senators have been pushing a doctrine of 
decentralization of the Imperial Mandate, and the transfer of power from 
the Imperial Senate to the local clusters.
