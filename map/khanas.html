Khanas is the largest moon of Shakul, and the sister moon of Kordia.

Khanas was colonized simultaneously with Kordia when the sector was first 
being evaluated for expansion during the late First Wave, but where as Kordia 
prospered, Khanas struggled with an much less habitable biosphere.

Records show that Kordia's colonial steward AI yielded control of her
fledgling colony to a human governing body after only 82 years of managed
operation, while the Khanian steward AI never yielded control, and 
triggered the "evacuate and decommission" procedures after 162 years.

After the Kanasian population were evacuated to Kordia and the initial 
colonization attempt was formally terminated, the Khanasian government
created the United Shakul Management Body (USMB) to manage Khanas as
an subject territory of Kordia along with Shakul and her smaller satellites.

When the Imperial Authority was established on Earth and Kordia was given
the Imperial Mandate for the sector, Khanas remained governed by the USMB, and
had several periods of industrial outposts, but never any formal permanent
settlements.

During the Wars of Sovereignty, Khanas was used as a reinforced defensive
bastion for the USMC defense initiative, and held even when Kordia were
sieged and bombarded by the federation, surrendering only after the formal 
treaty of capitulation were signed by the Senate following the defeat and death
of Empress Illia Desort.
