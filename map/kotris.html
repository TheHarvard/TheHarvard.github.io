Kotris is the largest moon of Muro in the Allisto system.

Rich in minerals, Kotris was colonized early in the history of the sector, and
has historically employed large amounts of artificial labour in it's mining 
operations.

While considered relatively simple manual-labour robots by the standards of
pre-scream technology, the technological base on Kotris to produce and maintain
Robots and Synthetics have arguably become more important to her economy and
survival than any mineral export following the Scream and Silence.

Studies show that 92% of new robots in the sector are build on Kotrisian 
designs, or designs derived from Kotrisian designs, and 53% are built in the
foundries of Kotris. By mass, more matter is exported from Kotris as part
of robots and synthetics than not.
