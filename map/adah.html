Little is known about Adah.

Following the recent re-discovery of the Thurid system, no contact has been
made with any population on Adah.
It is theorized that the populations of the Adanian colonies were not able to
survive the scream, or were somehow able to escape Adah, but there is no
general consensus.

One major point of contention is that pre-scream records does not seem to 
line up with Adah's current observed state. Maps and geo-scans differ
dramatically, large population centers are gone without a trace, and atmospheric 
and orbital parameters are significantly different.
Another source of confusion is the variation between scans from different
exploration and mapping excursions, and the dramatic errors found in the data.
