Clytea is a large planet caught very closely to the system star.
It's thick, stratified atmosphere creates an extreme greenhouse 
effect on it's surface, that can sometimes reach the 500Â°C's.
The existence of a breathable, oxygen rich atmosphere has been
a mystery since it's re-discovery.

Clytea is known as the landing site for anyone who wants to 
travel through the "Bansulo lanes" connecting the large clusters. 
They say engineers from Polomos came and repaired the ancient 
flying city that is now used to house the entirety of the 
planets population, as well as state of the art spaceports 
serving the majority of the Bansulo traffic.
The pressures and temperatures generally experienced at the
cruising altitudes of the flying city are generally considered
quite comfortable, allowing for suit-less recreation, like
watching the famous Clytean sunrises. 

The planet surface itself is a oppressive wasteland, with people 
exploring it only in the hope of finding another buried city.
