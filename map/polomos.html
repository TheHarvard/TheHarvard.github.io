Polomos is best known for it's surviving orbital ring and 
military industrial complex. While few of the ring segments have  
survived the silence unharmed, several shipyard segments have been 
brought online with the help of large Mefosan defense contracts.

The surface of Polomos is designated a military operations zone
and is nearly uninhabited outside the few operational elevator 
sites, mining towns and military sites required to support 
the ring. 

Beyond the daring Polomosian commando teams, and the occasional 
daredevil biologist or nature documentary, few see any point in
risking the featureless, snowball surface of Polomos, not to 
mention filling out mountain of paperwork required.
