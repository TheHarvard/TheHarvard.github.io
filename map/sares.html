Once a mining colony, and staging platform for Alldisian hydrogen
capture, Sares is now known as the "University Moon".
Many of Meris's best and brightest get their degrees from one of
the many research organizations here.

While being knows for its pro-research environment, Sares have very
complex systems of law and governance, simultaneously giving a very
high degree of independence for individual campuses, and requiring a
vast amount of bureaucracy and documentation.
