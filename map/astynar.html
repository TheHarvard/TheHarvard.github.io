While Astynar may appear hospitable from orbit, the surface
conditions are far from it. Astynar is dominated by incredibly
hostile bioforms, including;

- multi-storey arthropodal apex peredators,
- hyper allergens acutely lethal to human immune systems,
- cloud sized swarms of flesh eating insectoids,
- and city-sized carpets of slime-mold-like microbial scavengers.

No human settlement are known to have lasted more than 3 months.
Due to it's hostile ecology, Astynar has gotten the nickname
of "Styx", and is sometimes used in advertisements for survival
gear, ruggedized equipment, emergency response services, etc.

Some pre-scream records indicates that Astynar was much less
hostile in it's recent past.
