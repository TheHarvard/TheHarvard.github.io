Ermina is the first planet of the Allisto binary system.

Due to the triple issues of her severe lack of water, closeness to the
Allisto binary, and particularly hostile weather conditions;
Ermina is considered to be one of the most hostile planets to still sustain
any significant human population.

Ermina is covered with a unique class of monostructured sand that is able to
cut and tear vac-suits by simply being agitated by walking on it. Ermina is 
also experiencing continuous sandstorm able to strip the hull of spaceships.

The Erminian government recommends that no unplanned landings take place.
