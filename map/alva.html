Alva is a medieval world most notable 
for being the location of the many
reality tv media franchises of the
AURORA Media Group.

Due to the success of the "Alva-Verse",
Alva is technically the most famous
planet of the sector, and the planet
with the highest number of celebrities
per population.

As a result of the AURORA-Ruti joint
Entertainment Zone (AREZ), any
trespassing on or near Alva is highly
illegal, and enforced by the AURORA-Ruti
Corporate Undertaking of Security (ARCUS).

Critics have raised several questions
concerning the ethics of clandestine
mass surveillance and lack of informed
concent and compensation for Alvas
inhabitants, though no internal AREZ
audits have reported any illegal conduct.
