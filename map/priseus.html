Priseus is the furthest outmost planet of the Berin binary system, and is
covered completely by deep, frozen over oceans.

despite receiving nearly no heat from sunlight, Priseus keeps the lower layers 
of her oceans liquid through some poorly understood geothermal heating.
This heating is however not consistent, cause large and ever changing water
and ice tectonic and volcanic activity. 

Large ice mountain ridges coves Priseus's surface, growing as the large ice
sheets move, massive ice calderas and volcanoes dot the landscape.
During particular hot geothermal events it is also known that the ice can
melt through the entire ice surface to form water "windows" into the large
subterranean liquid oceans.
