"The founding"

2275 first war of succession
Following the death of Emperox Juliano Siglus I, third emperox of the 
imperial mandate, there was no imperial heir apparent.
It also became apparent that several colonies had had enough of imperial rule,
and saw this as an oportunity to secede from the imperial mandate.

While much is forgotten, it is generally agreed that the colonies fell into
two factions; Imperialists and Sovereigntist.
The Imperial faction consisted of the colonies of Pane, Abyss, Karis, and Dah
while the colonies of Mefos/Meris, Herg, Allisto more losely composed the
rebels sovereigntist.

The conflict lasted until 2277, when Empress Alejandra Ari of Sares/Meris
was elected as a compromize candidated.
She would go on to implement the governence reforms that created the
Houses Noble in 2278, putting the disperate colonies in fiefdom instead of
direct imperial rule.
