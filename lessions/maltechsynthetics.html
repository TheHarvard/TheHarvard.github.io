<pre>                      <b>MALTECH: SYNTHETICS AND ANDROIDS</b>
                     ----------------------------------


Androids and Synthetics are considered maltech by large parts of the sector.

  *  <b>Synths</b> are machines made of flesh that, near perfectly, mimic human biology.
They look like humans, act like humans, age like humans, live and die like humans.
They have bone, skin, and blood just the same as humans have.
But they are not humans, they are synths, and they are created by us, and for us.

Some pre regulation synths were made to have different attributes than
humans, and can have super-human strength, reflexes, intelligence, sight,
hearing etc. These are very dangerous individuals, able to blend in with
humanity, and reveal super-human abilities when cornered.

All modern synths are made with obvious markings identifying them as
SYGNET registered synths. Typically, this is an identification number around
the cornea, and safety features like obedience- and deactivation phrases.

Synths made before the implementation of these regulations are illegal and can
usually only be identified through psychic interview protocols conducted by
SYGNET Auditors or D-CON teams, or by highly specialized post mortem autopsies.
Early Synth purges relied heavily on captured Cydronics databases, but the
databases were never complete and some synths were deliberately kept paperless.

No synths are known to ever have been able to reproduce, or develop MES.

Synths are currently outlawed as maltech in the imperial core and
papal state, and a select other jurisdictions, and have only been legalized in
the rest of the sector very recently, and only under heavy regulation.


  *  <b>Androids</b> are machines made to mimic humans.
While convincing, they are inherently not synths, and relatively easily
identified as non-human. They are regulated similarly to synths, and are
outlawed in the imperial core and papal state.


  *  <b>Virtual Intelligences</b> are custom built pieces of software able to attain 
sub-human intelligence. A VI does not learn and develop, is a lot simpler than
an AI, and can never ascend to become an AI.
They are inherently identifiable as non-human, and generally allowed in the
sector, but their seeming similarity to AIs requires them to register with
SYGNET much like synths and androids.


  *  <b>Clones</b> are human beings created from the genetic material of only one
parent. Clones are not synths and are given full personhood before the law.
However, the process of cloning is generally considered Maltech; falling in
the grey area between the categories of Gene engineering Maltech and
Synthetic lifeforms Maltech, it has received inconsistent rulings over the ages. 


  *  <b>Cyborgs</b> are modified humans who have replaced or expanded parts of their
biological forms with mechanical or biological limbs, organs, etc.
Mechanical prosthetics are widely available in most systems, while bionic 
upgrades are less common but still available in more advanced systems.

Cyborgs have personhood before the law.

Modifying the brain directly is considered Maltech, so cybernetic designs must
steer clear of direct brain modification and interfacing to remain compliant.
