There are 10 Holy Virtues, and 10 Deadly Sins, with each pair of
sin and virtue diametrically opposed.

Together the virtues form the ladder; where each rung must form the
foundation for the next.
You can not build humility without faith, and you can not
build temperance without humility.
A life is a journey, where each step must be on this
divine stair to reach true salvation.
The sins similarly form a ladder, for doubt will lead to
overambition, and overambition will lead to indulgence.
It is a rot, all starting at doubt and all eventually ending in tyranny,
 if not interceded.

The first 5 virtues are the sinister virtues - counted on the left hand.
The last 5 virtues are the dexter virtues - counted on the right hand.
A low-born is expected to attain the first 5 virtues through faithfull,
humble, diligent and dutiful service to their lord.
The noble is expected to attain all ten, and represents his people in
matters of truth, charity, wisdom, honour and justice.

<pre>                           <b>The 10 Technologia Profana</b>


There are 10 profane technologies that must not be used or developed.
To be tempted by them, even in dire circumstances, is a fall that will
ensure the ruin of not only one's soul, but one's household, family and kinsmen.


<b>Daemonology</b>
    Daemons are great spirits brought about by our ancestors. Bound by
keys to serve us, they remain our responsibility to bear.
To invoke their name, and release them from the ancient seals, is a most
dire mistake. For they will lead you astray, hide you from God's light,
and render you to nothing.

1st Enoch 3
    11 And Azazel taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and
       breastplates, and made known to them the metals of the earth and the 
       art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of 
       antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of costly
       stones, and all colouring tinctures.
    12 And there arose much godlessness, and they committed fornication, and
       they were led astray, and became corrupt in all their ways.


<b>Locusta</b>
    Like a little yeast leavens the whole dough, and a single spark can
light a forests; one nanobot can spoil a world.
To permit such a machine to be created is to undo the divine work and thus
align oneself with the evil legion of the adversary.

Exodus 10
    14 they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the
       country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a
       plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again.
    15 They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all
       that was left after the hail—everything growing in the fields and
       the fruit on the trees.
       Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.


<b>Possessio Machina and Possessio Magi</b>
    To harden another's heart, blind  their eyes, and take away their
understanding, is to infringe on their free will. A slavery of the soul, with
no chance of emancipation.
We must not let machines nor false miracles enslave that soul which God gave
us to separate us from the beast, for it is what will keep us on path through
the darkness and deliver us into salvation.

John 8
    32 and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.


<b>The Cartesian Heresy</b>
    Only God can breath a soul into his miraculous creations.
The creation of a foul soulless homonculi is an affront to his name,
and one must not suffer the synthetic their mockery of life.

Psalm 115
    4 But their idols are silver and gold,
        made by human hands.
    5 They have mouths, but cannot speak,
        eyes, but cannot see.
    6 They have ears, but cannot hear,
        noses, but cannot smell.
    7 They have hands, but cannot feel,
        feet, but cannot walk,
        nor can they utter a sound with their throats.
    8 Those who make them will be like them,
        and so will all who trust in them.


<b>Gnosis Illicita</b>
    The Lord scattered us from Babylon, and exiled us from the eden for
our arrogance. Only God can give visions, only he gives true prophecy.
To seek prophecy or power outside of God is foolish neglect that
will only lead to ruin.
For God has provided for us all that is needed.

Deuteronomy 6
    15 for the Lord your God, who is among you, is a jealous God and his
       anger will burn against you, and he will destroy you from the face of
       the land. 
    16 Do not put the Lord your God to the test as you did at Massah. 


<b>False Thunder (The Great False Thunder - Magnum Tonitrus Falsum)</b>
    It is God's right alone to wield the sword of the outer dark.
To create weapons of mass destruction is arrogance against the divine order,
to take cruelty in ones own hands, and to seal one's eschatologic fate.

Matthew 24
    36 But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in
       heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.

Revelations 13
    11 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth;
       and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.
    13 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from
       heaven on the earth in the sight of men,
    18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of
       the beast: for it is the number of a man;
       and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.


<b>Imago Dei (Profanatio contra Imago Dei)</b>
    Man is the height of God's creation, for he created us in his own image.
To mock that image by taking it into one's own hands is a grave
profanity against God.
Shall the statue take up chisel and be his own sculptor?
Man shall not work the wonders of the human genome.

Genesis 12
    6 Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness,
      so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky,
      over the livestock and all the wild animals,
      and over all the creatures that move along the ground. 


<b>The Second Temptation</b>
    To seek to outlive one's time is an antediluvian ambition,
incompatible with the jealousy of God.
To prolong ones life or suspend it to unatural lenghts is overambition against
the divine work, for all your days are accounted for, 
and the gates do not await those who refuse their appointed hour.

Genesis 3
    22 And the Lord God said, “The man has now become like one of us, 
       knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and
       take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.”

Genesis 6
    3 And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for
      that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.

<b>Apostatic Technolatry</b>
    To rely on alien inventions is apostasy.
To implore their machines for aid is idolatry.
Rely instead on human thought, and the technology of your forefathers,
for we are God`s chosen people, and he has provided for us.

Deuteronomy 32
    16 They made him jealous with their foreign gods
        and angered him with their detestable idols.
    17 They sacrificed to false gods, which are not God—
        gods they had not known,
        gods that recently appeared,
        gods your ancestors did not fear.


Each profane technology is associated with a deadly sin:

                           Tyranny - Daemonology
                         Cowardice - Possessio Machina
                         Ignorance - Possessio Magi
                           Cruelty - False Thunder
                            Deceit - Imago Dei
                         Treachery - The Carthesian Heresy
                           Neglect - Gnosis Illicita
                        Indulgence - Locusta
                      Overambition - The Second Temptation
                             Doubt - Apostatic Technolatry
