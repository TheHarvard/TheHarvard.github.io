<pre>                    <b>History of Old Earth, and her Nations</b>


Little is known about the nations of old Earth that existed before the
formation of the Terran Mandate, but some records of them made it to the
sector on the earliest colony ships that arrived here.
While much of this data is lost, corrupt, or of uncertain providence,
the wider scientific community do agree on some things about
pre Terran Mandate Earth.

Here we will cover the nations of old earth that existed some time
between the invention of FTL travel in 2108, and the formation of the
Terran Mandate in 2199.
Note that several other nations and states are theorized to exist, and
that our aim is to cover only what can be backed up with records and
scientific consensus at time of writing (3222 AD).

<b>Background</b>

It is generally agreed upon that 22nd century earth was a planet experiencing a
significant amount of ecological stress. From the surviving records, it seems
like industrial byproducts, climate change and the fallout of primitive
thermonuclear weapons had significantly reduced the available resources.
Exclusion zones and sea level rise reduced available land, pollution and
droughts created food shortages, and the lack of sustainable fusion reactor
technologies meant that humanity burned hydrocarbons to satisfy their
high energy demand.
The population of old Earth is also estimated to have been around
10 Billion without significant urbanized arcologies, 
resulting in large unmanaged populations.

<b>Nations</b>

While it is difficult to determine what nations, cultures, ethnicities,
states and de facto states existed, and categorize them correctly as such,
an attempt has been made to render the de facto states as headers, and
include any significant cultures, nations and ethnicities as sub headers,
for the readers convenience.

The different states are also separated in the “continents” that we believe
Old Earth used to categorize their landmasses.
Please note that the “continents” were geographic terms and were not
states with individual governance.
It is unclear what criterion Old Earth used to define a continent,
but we believe it to be predominantly a cultural decision.

It is believed that the “Mediterranean” was an ocean of old earth, and that
the WMAC comprised several of the nations neighboring this ocean.
WMAC seems to have been a major power operating in the continents of
Europe and Africa.
Surviving literature indicated that WMAC contained several national identities:
Arabian, Spanish, Italian, Greek, Egyptian, Czech, Slovak, Iranian and Syrian.

or the name of a warlord.
The Khanate is noted to comprise Mongolian and Russian national identities.

<b>The Pan-Indian Union</b>
The PIU is believed to have been a significant contributor to the early
mapping of FTL routes, as they are noted to have been the first to
discover life outside of earth in 2150.
It is generally noted to consist of the following nations:

landmasses had been swallowed by rising sea levels.


                   <b>Nations of the continent of North America</b>


<b>California</b>
Often described as a “West coast state”, California seems to have been
pivotal in the development of early computing technology.

<b>State of Deseret</b>
Sometimes called the “Honeybee”, the State of Deseret is noted to have had
a particularly strong national identity.

<b>United Indian Councils</b>
It is unknown why the Pan-Indian Union and United Indian Councils are
located in different continents.

<b>Republic of Texas</b>
Texas had its own strong national identity, but also identified with Mexican

<b>Quebec</b>
Having a strong national identity mixing french and english roots,
not much is known about this state.

<b>United States of Canada and America</b>
The USCA is described as compromising several “East Coast” states. 
The USCA seems to have been a melting pot of various national
identities including American and Canadian.

<b>Confederate States of America</b>
Described as a collection of “Southern States” CSA seems to have seceded
from the USCA at some point during the century, and much of their national
identity, while similar to the USCA, focus on how they are not the USCA.

Mexico is believed to have been one of the older nations of the 22nd century.
Its culture has particular representation in surviving artifacts, and it is
theorized that it had a complex and ancient culture.


                   <b>Nations of the continent of South America</b>


<b>Gran Columbia</b>
Gran Columbia seems to have been a major nation on the South American
continent, but few records survive on its structure.

<b>Amazonia</b>
Amazonia is believed to have been a young nation, and seems to have been
formed in response to a power vacuum following one of the old earth wars.

<b>Patagonia</b>
Patagonia is often described as a southern state, and sometimes identified
as comprising Chilean, Argentina and Uruguayan and Paraguayan nations.
A Patagonian national identity also seems to have existed.

<b>Great Falkland Isles</b>
The Great Falkland Isles seem to have been a significant island nation,
with its own national identity.


                       <b>Nations of the continent of Africa</b>


<b>South Africa</b>
Despite departing from the general naming convention, “South Africa" is
believed to have been a sovereign state and not a continent. 
It is however believed to comprise much of the southern part of Africa,
the continent.

<b>Malisonghai</b>
A coastal state reported to have put significant efforts into
desert reclamation.
Sometimes referred to as “Green Sahara”.

<b>Madagascar</b>
Believed to be an island in Africa, Madagascar seems to have had its own
national identity.
It is therefore theorized to have been a relatively small island.


                     <b>Nations of the continent of Antarctica</b>


<b>Antarctic Peace State</b>
The APS is theorized to have been an international effort to build a
nation from the ground up in uncontaminated land in the “Antarctic”.
It seems like Antarctica was a continent with a historically severely
hostile environment, that became less hostile due to climate change.

<b>Australia</b>
Suffering from a similarly hostile environment, Australia seems to have been
another Antarctic state.
Some scientific authorities argue that Australia was considered to
belong to Asia at some point during the 23rd century.
