                  ---------------------------------------------


<b>> Cybernetics</b>

Cybernetics are artificial, mechanical or biological extensions or replacement
for a person's body. A person with cybernetic parts is called a Cyborg.
Cyborgs should not be confused with androids, which are wholly artificial
bodies classified as synthentic-lifeforms-as-maltech.

Mechanical cybernetics are relatively common in most civilized systems, and
enable significant improvements to the living standards of persons in need of
prosthetics or organ replacements. They are also sometimes used to extend the
natural ability of humans, for specialized work or for enthusiasts, but this
can be a fine balance of the utility of having potentially bulky hardware
integrated into one's body at all times, against using external equipment to
the same effect.

Biological cybernetics are artificial body parts made out of engineered living
or near-living tissue, and generally integrate much more organically into the
body. They are rarer than the simpler mechanical cybernetics, and more
expensive, but available in some systems.

<pre><b>> Brain editing Maltech</b>

The direct access, copying, editing, of direct brain data is declared as
illegal as Maltech, independent of what means the access is facilitated by,
be it bio-mechanical or psionic.

Due to this limitation, cybernetic implants need to be hooked up to the
central nervous system in very specific ways that let the user interface with
them, and learn to use them, but does not expand the total interfacing surface
area of the brain.

<pre><b>> Maltech, Cognition Hazards</b>

A brain is just a computer, the software of which is modified every moment of
our lives as we grow, learn and expand our knowledge and skills.
Our experiences then inform how our brains decide that we make decisions,
act and feel.

Similar to a computer, “software” can be architected for the brain to be self
propagating patterns of thoughts, convictions and behaviour. We generally call
the study of these self propagating patterns for Memetics.

Most memes are harmless or even beneficial; in-jokes, cultural touchstones, and
social norms are all memes. Some memes are counter to imperial interests and
are therefore regulated. Whilst not inherently dangerous to an individual,
these memes are dangers to the collective.
However, memes that can unwittingly “install” themselves in one's brain and be
immediately hazardous to the person and their surroundings, are considered
Memetic cognition hazards.

Memetic cognition hazards are very intricate, and consequently vulnerable
systems. It is therefore usually possible to disrupt an active cognition hazard.
The variation between individual brains makes it hard to predict who might be
more or less susceptible to a specific cognition hazard.

- Cognition hazards can have several vectors of transmission:
- Speech/Writing
- Visual Images
- Auditory sounds
- Computer Brain Interfaces
- Psionic transference

Whilst Memetic cognition hazards are incredibly hard to manufacture, the risk
of accidentally creating or propagating a cognition hazard has been used to
argue for the banning of all direct copying or modification of a person's
experience, memory, or skills through mechanical brain/computer interfaces or
psionic means as maltech.


<b>Avoiding Cognition Hazards</b>

Modern computer systems are designed to hinder cognition hazards from
propagating through information sent through them. If, however, you suspect you
have received an active cognition hazard in a computer system, do not
look at, listen to, connect to or interact with that system. Power the system
down if possible, quarantine the system and yourself to the best of your
ability, and contact your nearest Anti Memetics- or Maltech authority.

If you suspect you are in an area where cognition hazards might be found in
the physical environment, immediately limit your senses to those absolutely
necessary for you to leave the area, and then attempt to do so.
Once clear of the suspected area, quarantine yourself to the best of your
ability and contact your nearest Anti Memetics- or Maltech authority.


<b>Identifying and Disrupting a Cognition Hazard in another person</b>

If you observe a person having a drastic change in personality, mannerism, or
goals, becoming unresponsive, unconscious, or disappearing, after looking at
an image, hearing a sound, or interfacing with a computer system;
they might be suffering from an active Cognition Hazard.
Do not expose yourself to the apparent source of the Cognition Hazard, and
notify your nearest Anti Memetics- or Maltech authority immediately.
If no authority is available, you may attempt to disrupt the cognition hazard by
inflicting sharp pain to the person. If that yields no result, talk them
through the various methods of disruption described under the next header. 

   <b>Remember; even if they seem unresponsive, delusional, or have disappeared,</b>
                   <b>they might still be able to hear you!</b>


<b>Identifying and Disrupting a Cognition Hazard in yourself</b>

If you find yourself suddenly somewhere unfamiliar, amnestic, or confused after
looking at an image, hearing a sound, or interfacing with a computer system,
you might be experiencing an active cognition hazard. 

Remember that you are in control, and able to disrupt the cognition hazard
through finding the correct counter thought pattern. Remember your training,
and start visualizing various return patterns until you find one that seems to
affect the cognition hazard. Then iterate on the pattern until you find one
that stops the cognition hazard.
If visual return patterns do not work, proceed to auditory return patterns,
and abstract return patterns. Cognition patterns have near-infinite solutions
for return patterns, <b>you just have to find one of them.</b>

Once you manage to disrupt the cognition hazard, immediately inform any other
persons at risk of exposure to the cognition hazard of the return pattern that
worked, and immediately quarantine yourself and contact your nearest
Anti Memetics- or Maltech authority.


<b>Psionic Intersectionality</b>

Some Cognition Hazards target specifically persons of
Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome. Considering how MES causes
a personto be able to psychically affect the world around them,
these Cognition Hazards can be incredibly dangerous.

Other Cognition Hazards can induce MES like states in otherwise healthy brains.
