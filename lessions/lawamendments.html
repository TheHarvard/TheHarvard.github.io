</pre>


<pre>
                              <u>The Imperial Mandate</u>
    
    The Imperial Mandate was issued in 2199 by The Terran Mandate of Earth
    shortly after the dissolution of the nations of old earth.
    It is the foundational document of imperial sovereignty, and later
    amendments have been made to the Imperial Mandate.

    Translation Excerpt:

            "The Terran Mandate of Earth, Sovereign of all humanity,
            greets her colonies and sees and recognizes the sector of
            Icarus Sigma, comprising those stellar systems setteled by
            the 7 ships, and all of their decendants:
          
    The DDR EISSTAHL, who landed in the system of Pane in 2156,
    and founded the colonies of Kordia and Khanas.

    The Kikyō Yamato, who landed in the system of Meris in 2162
    and founded the colonies of Mefos.

    The Aldred, who landed in the system of Bansulo in 2168,
    and founded the colonies of Clytea

    The SS Alexandria, who landed in the system of Meris in 2170,
    and founded the colonies of Sares.

    The L’Espérance d’Avalon, who landed in the system of Creusa in 2171,

           We call from amongst you the colonies of Kordia to rise
           and recieve this Imperial Mandate, and for Hans Theodore
           Kordignia to hold its office; as supreme executor of the
           will of the Terran Mandate in Icarus Sigma.

           The nations you left on earth are no more,
           but yet your duties remain, not to a single nation,
           but to all of humanity; a unified Terran Mnadate."
