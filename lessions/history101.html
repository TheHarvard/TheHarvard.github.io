<pre>                                  <b>History 101</b>


The history of humanity stretches back thousands of years.
Here is covered the most Influential events one should be familiar with.


                 <b>2108 - 2330: The First wave of Colonization</b>


<b>> 2108 Dr. Tiberius Crohn discovers faster than light travel</b>
    Dr. Crohn invents the Spike Drive, and surprises the nations of Old Earth by
jumping to Alfa-Centauri, returning to transmit the plans for his device, and
then jumping out to never be heard from again.
The start shot is fired in the greatest race in human history:
the various nations of Old Earth scramble to lay claim to the
 new worlds and their resources.

<b>> 2128 - 2199  The Sector is mapped and settled</b>
    The Sector is mapped, named, and the nation of Old Earth send a handful of
colonizing missions to stake their claims. These include:
	The DDR EISSTAHL
	帰郷大和 - The Kikyō Yamato
	The Aldred
	The SS Alexandria
	The L’Espérance d’Avalon 
	The Pioneer
	The Bivrost

<b>> 2199 The Imperial Mandate is formed</b>
    As the many worlds of the galaxy started to outpace Old Earth in both
population, industrial output and cultural prevalence, the nations of old
earth decided to form a unified governing authority; The Terran Mandate.
The call for a sectoral authority was made from Earth, and Kordia won the
nomination for Imperial Throneworld.
The Imperial Mandate becomes the sovereign authority of the sector,
beholden only to Old Earth.

<b>> 2243 First case of MES in the sector</b>
    Metadimensional Extroversion Syndrome emerges. A strange brain-
condition enabling abilities unexplainable by conventional science,
it is determined to be linked to the work underpinning Dr Crohn's invention
of the Spike Drive.
The condition has a near 100% lethality by age 18, but research is
started on treatments.

<b>> 2275 - 2277 First Conflict of Succession</b>
    The first Conflict of Succession arises over the decentralization of
power away from a totalitarian imperial throne, and the conflict only end
with the compromise of the Houses Noble.

<b>> 2278 The Houses Noble are established</b>
    To better represent each world's interests, 10 Noble Houses were founded to
rule the 10 colonies in fiefdom under the imperial throne.

<b>> 2281 The Imperial Psionic College is established</b>
    The first training program for persons with MES enables the condition to
be stabilized, and eventually mastered. Psionic techniques, technologies and
innovations start changing what is possible.


                 <b>2330 - 2665: The Second wave of Colonization</b>


<b>> 2347 The first psionic jumpgate is built in the Sector</b>
    Enabled by innovations in psionic technologies, the psionic jumpgates makes
the old spike drives invented by Dr Crohn redundant. They enable instant
translating from one system to another, as long as they both have gates.
The sector quickly becomes part of the larger jumpgate network.

<b>> 2380 The first AI arrives in the Sector</b>
    Following their initial creation on Old Earth and the passing of the
Firstborn Pact in 3278, True Artificial Intelligences started spreading across
the galaxy. 
With the mental capacity of several dozen humans, these mechanical minds
usually found their way to the tops of various governments and organizations.
Though the arrival of the first AI also heralded the arrival of the
first Daemons; crazed Artificial Intelligences driven mad by the illegal
removal of the brakes keeping them in check.

<b>> 2391 The Imperial Company is established</b>
    Following the expansion into previously uncolonized systems,
the Imperial Company is chartered to manage these new holdings.
The recent arrival of AI and new psionic manufacturing techniques quickly
make it the de-facto research and manufacturing monopoly for the whole sector.

<b>> 2492 - 2511 Second Conflict of Succession (Wars of the Houses)</b>
    Following the rule of Emperor Hans Theodore Kordignia III “the corrupt”,
the sector is unable to elect a new emperox.
The prolonged civil war only ended with the election of Emperox Peyote.

<b>> 2512 The Imperial Church is established</b>
    Emperox Peyote “the saint” is elected to the Imperial Throne, ending the
second conflict of succession. They pass numerous reforms focusing on the
sectors spiritual and religious wellbeing, banning open war between the houses,
and establishing the Papal state of Bizoglos.

<b>> 2530 - 2665 The Golden Age</b>
    The ascension of Emperox Juliano Siglus II, “the eternal” to the
throne marks the start of the Golden Age for the sector, and for the
wider galactic community.
Most worlds live in post scarcity, psionic technology enables wonders that
were only before conceivable as magic, Artificial Intelligences optimize 
societies and resolves conflicts before they can even start.


                       <b>2665 - 2968: The silence</b>


<b>> 2665 The Scream</b>
    Ripping across the galaxy in mere minutes, the Scream was a
psychic event of unimaginable proportion the likes of which have
never been seen before nor since.
It caused in rapid succession the destruction of the entire
psionic jump gate network, the end of psionically assisted manufacturing
and the corruption of every Psyker into raging mad angels of destruction.
Even after most Psykers had burned themselves out; with the whole
transportation infrastructure and manufacturing technology of the latter
second wave gone in moments, most urbanized worlds starved and were
cast into chaos, and those less developed worlds were cut off from
essential supplies from the wider galaxy.
With every colony lying with broken backs, the silences started.
And it would last for three centuries.


                       <b>2968 - 3225: The Reawakening</b>


<b>> 2968 First contact post-scream</b>
    For the first time since the scream, contact was re-established between
Kordia and Samida. This marks the beginning of the Reawakening, where the
sector was slowly but surely knitting itself back together.

<b>> 2985 The Imperial Senate is established</b>
    Following the re-establishment of contact with the Merisian cluster, a
compromise was struck to have the various worlds of the cluster peacefully
re-admit themselves to the Imperial Mandate.
As part of this, the Imperial Senate was established to better represent the
interests of the colonies, and house Glatisant and House Pell were formally
recognized as Noble Houses.

<b>> 3030 Slavery is outlawed</b>
    In response to the wide availability of cheap android and synthetic
labour coming out of Cydronics from Kotris in the Allisto system,
Human slavery was outlawed by imperial decree.

<b>> 3043 The Anesinian Crisis</b>
    When contact was established with the planet Anesin in the Berin system,
it was discovered that a myriad of new, anthropomorphic human gene-lines had
been created there during the silence.
This sparked a wide controversy and moral panic that resulted in the
12th amendment being passed in 3044, outlawing human gene-engineering but
universally pardoning those created by it, allowing the new gene-line to
assimilate into the Sector.

<b>> 3156 The star Oiterus goes supernova</b>
    Oiterus becomes the first star to have been observed from within its own
system as it underwent supernova. The event inspired sector wide research-
cooperation, and was one of the most widely published events since the
reawakening.

<b>> 3111 The Cartesian Heresy is declared</b>
    The Imperial Church declares the Cartesian Heresy, and Empress Illia Desort
passes the 13th amendment calling for the complete ban and eradication of
all machines imitating human life. 
The purge of synthetic life cast much of the sector into chaos.

<b>> 3109 - 3113 The Wars of Sovereignty</b>
    A sector spanning war between the Imperial Mandate and the Federation, an
alliance consisting predominantly of alien planets.
Following the battle of Samida and death of Empress Illia Desort in 3113,
the Imperial Mandate sues for peace and the declaration of surrender is
signed on Meris later the same year.
No new Emperox is elected to succeed Empress Illia Desort.

<b>> 3199 The Malleck Crisis</b>
    House Malleck tries to nominate a candidate for the imperial throne for
the millennial anniversary of the Imperial Mandate, starting the clock on
the election to be held.
The wider Imperial community almost universally denounces house Malleck and
their candidate, and the nomination is eventually pulled.
