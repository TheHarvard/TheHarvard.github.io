<pre>                                  <b>GEOGRAPHY 101</b>
                                 ---------------


The sector, as it stands today, consists of several distinct clusters.

<b>The Merisian cluster</b>
    Generally depicted in the “north western” part of the sector, the
Merisian cluster contains the systems of Meris, Herg and Creusa. 
Meris has long been a contender for the sector's most influential system,
but has historically lost out to the imperial authority of Pane. 
Meris has always fought for a less centralized form of sectoral governance,
and the royal houses of the Meris and Herg systems have in large parts yielded
their privileges to democratically elected governments.

<b>The Corporate cluster</b>
    Usually depicted opposite the merisian cluster, the corporate cluster
consists of the systems of Ruti, Phio and Allisto.
Called so for its historical association with the company, and the
strong megacorporations in its systems, the corporate cluster was in
large parts the domain of the imperial company before the scream.
Following the scream the company has been fragmented, and many of the
new corporations permeating the cluster claim to have rights to
the old imperial charters of the company.

<b>The Imperial Core</b>
    The imperial core is the home of the imperial throne on Kordia, in the
Pane system, as well as the imperial bureaucracies and judiciaries.
Samida is generally also considered to be part of the imperial cluster.
Often rendered in the “Center-south” on sector maps, the imperial cluster lies
somewhat distant from the Merisian and Corporate clusters, and have had a
general decline in the century after the wars of sovereignty,
as the imperial throne has sat empty.
Some consider Bansulo to also be part of the imperial core.

<b>The Triangle and Bansulo</b>
    Bridging the northern clusters with the imperial cluster is the Bansulo
system, and usually depicted to the “east” of Bansulo is the “Triangle”,
consisting of Maja, Thorgun and Alcipid.
Generally, this region of the sector has not been able to maintain the rule of
law against the pressures of pirates, rebels and aliens, and are today unruly,
with a reputation of headstrong separatists and organized crime.

<b>The Fringe</b>
    The Fringe are a number of sparse systems on the “west-south-west” side of
the sector. Last to be re-discovered, the fringe has remained largely
inconsequential in the greater political stage of the sector.
It consists of the systems; Sona, Cymede, Thurid, and Karis.
(Though some argue that Karis is part of the Federation instead)

<b>The Federation</b>
    During the wars of sovereignty the imperial mandate declared a collective
war against the “Federation”, a defensive league of various alien worlds.
Once the federation defeated the black lioness in the battle of Samida, and
the imperial mandate capitulated, the imperial mandate agreed to cede several
worlds in the Dah and Berin systems to the Federation.
Some consider the Alcipid and Karis systems to also be part of the Federation.

<b>The Lost Worlds</b>
    Only a fraction of the sector has been rediscovered since the scream, and
many lost worlds are theorized to be accessible given the right FTL routes.
However, such trailblazing exploration is incredibly dangerous and resource
intensive, and have not been attempted on a large scale since the 
rediscoveryof the Thurid system yielded very little return on the
investment made to re-establish the route.
