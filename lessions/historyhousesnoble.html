                           <b>History of the Houses Noble</b>


The houses noble were formed in 2277 by the passing of the 3rd amendment to
the constitution of the imperial mandate by Empress Alejandra Ari.

The amendment aimed to decentralize some power away from the imperial
throne and to the other colonies, and created a class of noble privilege that
could govern each colony system in fiefdom, without the direct involvement of
the imperial throne.

There were 10 established colonies when the amendment was passed, and 10 
houses were originally created to rule them in fiefdom.
Those 10 were:

<b>> House Kordignia (Major House)</b>, of the Pane system.
    “Laureis Coronati - With Laurels Crowned”
The ruling house of Kordia, and the descendants of Emperor Hans Theodore
Kordignia I, the first emperor. They hold many important positions in the 
imperial judiciary, as well as SYGNET, and have held the imperial
throne regularly both before and after the scream.


<b>> House Siglus (Lost Major House)</b>, of the Abyss system.
    “Æterni  - Everlasting”
Siglus was destroyed following the scream and silence. Much of the information
about them is lost, but they held the imperial throne for several periods
pre-scream. 
It is said that Emperox Juliano Siglus II “The eternal” created Samida.


<b>> House Ari (Major House)</b>, of the Meris system.
    “From Tyranny's shadow”
The House of Empress Alejandra Ari, of Meris. Sometime during the silence
House Ari abdicated their governance of Meris to the CCC, Meris's
democratically elected governing body.
They still represent Meris and the CCC in matters of nobility before
the imperial throne.

<b>> House Malleck (Minor House)</b>, of the Herg system.
    “Lupi Emperocis - Wolves of the Emperox”
House Malleck is a proud house with a long history of serving in the
imperial forces. Its battalions were instrumental in the initial push to
break Aisa, and suffered heavy losses during the Monener crisis.
It has however fallen out of favor following the Malleck crisis, and now
House Pell formally represents the Herg system.


<b>> House Baro / House Glatisant (Minor House)</b>, of the Creusa system.
    “Virtute Resurgimus - Virtuous, Arisen”
Since the reawakening, House Glatisant of Canomed has claimed the rights of
House Baro by unbroken lineage, and was recognized as a legitimate
successor house by the imperial throne during the reawakening.
House Glatisant is organizes more losely than other houses, consisting of
several families of Canomed interwoven by oaths and fielties.


<b>> House Castella (Minor House)</b>, of the Ruti system.
    “Sorte et Gladio - By fate and sword”
House Castella has always been a smaller house, and have a complicated
history with the imperial company and its successors.
When the 7th amendment was passed by Emperox Peyote to end the
Wars of the Houses, he named house castella to oversee the execution of
judicial duels as a neutral party.


<b>> House Kanayama 金山家  (Lost Minor House)</b>, of the Allisto system.
    “塵より生まれし者 - Ex Pulvere - Of dust”
The governing house of Kotris, House Kanayama, was essential to
Cydronics’s efforts to develop synthetic humans based on the pre scream
mining androids found on Kotris. They were highly involved with the
Imperial Company pre-scream, but were expunged along with Cydronics following
the outlawing of synths as maltech in 3107.


<b>> House Hator (Lost Minor House)</b>, of the Bansulo system.
    “Aureis Alis - On wings of gold”
The Bansulo system was hit particularly hard by the scream and silence.
House Hator used to govern the system from great flying cities on Clytea, but
following the reawakening that dynasty never reemerged, and all their cities
were lost to the hellish venusian surface of Clytea.


<b>> House Tannhauser (Lost Minor House)</b>, of the Karis system.
    “Imago Dei - In his image”
The Karis system was hit hard during the wars of sovereignty,
and House Tannhauser was lost with the fall of its home, Astotho.


<b>> House Berkman (Minor House)</b>, of the Dah system.
    “Awakened, we stand for peace”
The Dah system was ceded to the Federation following the end of the
wars of sovereignty. House Berkman has since taken a pro-federation
assimilation stance, to the chagrin of much of the imperial community.


Since the founding of the original houses, several “new” houses have been
established and recognized by the imperial throne. 

These are as follows:

<b>> House Peyote (Major House)</b>
    “Solus contra Tenebras - Alone against the darkness”
Founded in 2511 by the ascension of Peyote to the imperial throne following
the second conflict of succession.
House Peyote have been the governing house of Bizogloz, and led the
papal state for the majority of its history.


<b>> House Samav (Major House)</b>
    “Salus - Deliverance”
Founded in 2666 by the emergence of Mepress Edith Samav, Messiah of Kordia.
The messiah unified Kordia in the difficult times of the Silence, and her
house ruled Kordia for almost 200 years. 


<b>> House Desort (“Lost” Major House)</b>
    “Omnibus Modis - By any means”
Following the scream and silence, the Desort clan rose to rule Samida.
Once contact was reestablished between Kordia and Samida in 2968, Empress
Thea Kordignia II chose to acknowledge the House Desort as a true noble house.
Following the Wars of Sovereignty large parts of House Desort were
expunged by martial courts for their role in the conflict.


<b>> House Pell (Minor House)</b>, of the Herg system.
    “Repentant, we serve”
Sometime during the silence, Xana shed the “Xana Penal Administration” and
instead chose to govern themselves through democratic principles.
When the imperial mandate reestablished contact with Xana, a lengthy
negotiation between Kordia, Meris and Xana about the future of Xana resulted
in the formation and recognition of House Pell to formally govern Xana as
an imperial house, without the imperial mandate pardoning any of
the common Xanians.
