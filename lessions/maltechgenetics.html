<b>> Human Diversity</b>

There exists several distinct sub-species of Human in the sector, that are the
result of artificial or natural genetic pressure.


<b>Standard Human Gene Reference</b> 
    The standard human gene reference makes up around 97% of the human 
population in the sector. It expresses a large veriety of skin tones,
hair colour and texture, and eye color. With the exception of the
Samidanhigh breed, the SHGR is the only gene pattern known to develop 
MES with any regularity.


<b>Bizoglosians</b> 
    The human population of Bizoglos (Allisto) apare significantly altered from 
the standard reference, and are able to breathe the corrosive atmosphere of 
their planet. This leaves them resistant to many pollutants and diseases, but
it also manifests through a generally larger and stronger build, and somewhat
reduced average intelligence, and a seeming immunity to developing MES. 

There exists little research on the Bizoglosian gene pattern that is not
severely biased by the specific culture of Bizoglos (Allisto), which is
often described as tribal, religious, and technologically primitive.

The Bizoglosians are categorically referred to as “Nephilim” by the papal
state and imperial mandate, and sometimes colloquially referred to as
“Neandertals” in other parts of the sector.


<b>Samidan high breed</b> 
    Resulting from long term strategic breeding, the nobility of Samida (Abyss)
have separated significantly from the standard human gene reference. 

As the Samidan culture favors Psionic aptitude in their rulers, the Noble class
has evolved to have a much higher prevalence of MES, with significantly higher
average expression. As a consequence of this strong pressure, immuno-conditions
and complications from MES are also more prevalent.

Samidan high breed are very rare outside of the nobility of Samida (Abyss), but
sometimes families with half or quarter high breeds are known to exist in the
sector at large.


<b>Anesinians</b> 
    The Anesinian gene patterns (sometimes called Antropomorphs) are a 
number of Human-animal hybrid and Human-variation gene patterns that were
originally created on the planet Anesin (Berin) during the Silence. 

Some of them include:

    > Squat Hybrid
    A wide pattern with a lot of internal variation. Generally characterized by
    smaller builds, wider hair growth, and sometimes rodent-esk traits. 

    > Feline / Canine pattern
    Social gene patterns theorized to have been created for no purpose beyond
    their novelty.

    > Avian pattern
    Hollow boned, feathered and capable of limited flight in
    compatible atmospheres.

    > Amphibian pattern
    Aquatic adaptations enabeling sub-oceanic habitation but limiting 
    tolerance for heat and desecation.

While the creation of new Human gene patterns is considered Maltech, the
Anesinian patterns remain from a time where Human gene editing had not yet
been condemned.


<b>Koulotisians</b> 
    While Koulotisians rarely venture into the sector at large, they are known
to deviate significantly from the standard human gene reference.

<pre><b>> Human Gene-engineering, Maltech and Legality</b> 
    
    The artificial editing of human genetic material is declared Maltech by
imperial decree. Universal for all Human-geneediting-as-maltech, is the
automatic pardon of any person created as the result of it.
This means that persons of the sector created by geneediting maltech, or who
are natural descendants from persons created by maltech, can not be
held responsible, be punished for, or lose their personhood as a result of
their involvement in the maltech that created them.

    <b>Any genetic engineering of human genetic material is illegal as Maltech.</b>

Cloning is the practice of creating a human offspring with the genetic
material of only one parent, and it is considered Maltech.

“Natural” eugenics and breeding programs have been adjudicated both as Maltech,
and as legal practice depending on the courts and circumstances.
Historical precedence has been highlighted as an important factor in
determining legality.

“Naturally” co-mingeling alien and human genes is considered maltech by
the papal state and imperial core, but generally this will never result in
actual genetic hybridization, and is enforced mostly as a moral restriction. 

There is precedence for selective tolerance of human gene engineering being
deployed in a medical capacity to correct for genetic diseases, mutation or 
damage, but then only with the purpose of restoring a function as close to
the standard gene patterns as possible.

<pre><b>> Non-human Geneengineering</b> 

In addition to human genetic diversity, the sector has a wide variation of
non-human gene-engineered species.
The worlds with the most extensive engineered biology include:

<b>Xana AgriWorld™</b> 
    The planet Xana (Herg) is known for developing hardened genetic 
patterns of a myriad of old Earth staple foods, that are marketed under 
the AgriWorld™ trademark, like;
“AgriWorld™ Potato®”,       “AgriWorld™ Sweet Melon®”,
“AgriWorld™ Sitrus Stalk®”, “AgriWorld™ Red Berry®”,
“AgriWorld™ Bana®”,     and “AgriWorld™ NutraPulp®”.

The work done on Xana is the backbone for the nutritional infrastructure
feeding the larger Merisian cluster.

<b>Grimhild</b> 
    The planet Grimhild (Thorgun) was in the middle of being terraformed as the
silence started following the scream. Since her rediscovery in 3059, studies
have shown that her gene engineered biosphere is unstable, and research is
being conducted on how to best preserve and stabilize the interrupted
Terraforming process, and if any uniquely useful engineered gene-pattern can
be recovered for study and use.

<b>Kozardiskian Squid</b> 
    The planet Kozardisk (Creusa) was originally settled to be a genetic
engineering quarantine world, and since the silence has been re-cataloging the
many experiments existing in her boundless ocean and many islands.

The most famous of these is perhaps the genetic variation of the
old Earth squid, which has been shown to be able to attain near human
intelligence and basic language.
