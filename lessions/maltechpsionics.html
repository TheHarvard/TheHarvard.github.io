                          ---------------------------


<b>> MES Research and Treatment</b>

<b>Psionics</b> (manifesting through Metadimensional Extroversion Syntrome) is the
ability of some persons to manifest change in the world through manipulating
the same extra-dimensional physics that are foundational to FTL travel with
spike drives. Generally, MES is a condition of the brain that enables this
aberrant ability.

MES usually manifests in the early teens, can cause wildly dangerous effects in
or around the patient and, unless it is treated, has a near 100% fatality
rate by the age of 18.
In lieu of appropriate treatment it is generally recommended to seek
euthenasia before the late stages of the condition can manifest.

Some worlds have developed crude methods of suppression that can allow a
person with MES to keep the condition at bay for years if not decades.
Whilst invaluable during the silence, these methods are risky, and vastly
inferior to the new protocols developed by the Samidan Psionics Institute (SPI).
Due to the risks, unsanctioned MES research and treatment is considered Maltech.

Patients with MES are required to register with SYGNET, and once they have
enrolled in SPI and completed their training they are granted houseless
imperial citizenship as part of the Imperial College.

In recent years, the Pionics Academy of Kosardisk (PAK) has been granted the
imperial warrants and licenses to provide MES treatment.

<pre><b>> Legal and Illegal psionic techniques</b>

Psionic abilities are generally separated into 6 categories, or "Disciplines":

    <b>Biopsionics</b> is the application of MES abilities to directly affect
the body and biological processes. Any TL5 hospital will staff at least a
couple of biopsionisist, and their ability can significantly enhance the
efficacy of conventional medicine.

    <b>Metapsionics</b> is techniques used to modify one's own psionic ability,
or other psionics or their abilities. Tutors that help new MES patients learn
to use their abilities are specialized in metapsionics.

    <b>Precognition</b> is the use of MES to calculate or intuit possible
futures, and “see” the future. Often employed in analytical positions in 
governments or corporations or organizations; Precogs are sometimes
controversial in the edge they can give their patrons.

    <b>Telekinesis</b> permits the user to remotely physically affect the
world around them. Telekinetists are most common in developing worlds lacking
in equipment, in zero-g enviornments, in specialized military forces.

    <b>Telepathy</b> Is the use of MES to remotely transmit information between
individuals. While many of the telepathic techniques border on Maltech when
used against humans, they are legal when deployed against animals, aliens, or
synths. Therefore, many telepaths find work in xenopolitics, agriculture,
or as SYGNET auditors or D-COM specialists.

    <b>Teleportation</b> lets the user transport themselves and/or others near
instantly through space. This ability makes them invaluable for express
delivery services, law enforcement and intelligence work. 

  &lt!&gt  Due to the condemnation of direct brain editing as Maltech,
certain Biopsionic and Telepathic techniques are considered 
illegal as Maltech when used against humans.

  &lt!&gt  Due to the condemnation of unlicensed MES treatment as Maltech,
techniques developed beyond the categories officially recognized are 
illegal as Maltech.
This includes “Torching” which is the illegal technique of disregarding safety
protocols to attain more short term psionic potency at the cost of control.
