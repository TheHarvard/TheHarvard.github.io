<pre><b>> Maltech 101</b>

Maltech is illegal technology which pose severe dangers to individuals,
groups of individuals, or the integrity of the Imperial Mandate as a whole,
and are therefore banned from being researched, harboured, used, or otherwise
created or deployed by anyone independent of social class.

Generally, maltech includes the following 7 categories:
(In order of descending severity)

- Daemons, and unsanctioned AI creation
- Self replicating Nanomachines
- Brain editing, and Cognition hazards
- Thermonuclear, and Anti-Matter Weaponry
- Unsanctioned MES research and treatment
- Human genetic engineering
- Human-imitating Synthetic Lifeforms (varies by system)


The practice of maltech can be punished with capital punishment for all classes,
and is second only to treason against the imperial throne.

Crimes concerning maltech are always adjudicated by imperial maltech courts in
the Imperial Core, and the imperial judiciary employs specialized investigators
and prosecutors outside the normal marshal organization for this task.

The imperial church has also founded inquisitorial orders to root out the use of
maltech, particularly during the Cartesian Heresy.

The Imperial Church has their own list of 10 profane technologies:

- Daemonology
- Locusta
- Possessio Machina
- Possessio Magi
- The Cartesian Heresy
- Gnosis Illicita
- False Thunder (The Great False Thunder - Magnum Tonitrus Falsum)
- Imago Dei (Profanatio contra Imago Dei)
- The Second Temptation
- Apostatic Technolatry
