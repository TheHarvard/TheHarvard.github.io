It is the year 3224, and the myriad worlds of the Sector are halfway
through the first generation to not remember the great war.
111 years since the end of the war of sovereignty and its senseless violence.
111 years since the death of the last Empress, and 111 years of the imperial
senate refusing to elect a new emperox, and keeping their noses out of
most folks` business.

Great progress has been made in this last century; Industry and
technology have taken the innovations of war, and turned them to
peacetime purposes. Personal computing devices,  cyberware, metatools,
virtual assistants and mass produced space-ships now benefit everyone, and
not only the militarily-budgeted.

Social issues have come a long way; more and more worlds are letting go of
old, outdated mindsets, and it seems that even reconciliation with the
federation might be possible, despite their war veterans still being
considered mere youngsters amongst their kin.
With such long lives, lifelong grudges may be truly impractical;
there is so much we can learn from one another.

But every advancement has its countermovements.
Synth and cybernetic reforms are being blocked in the imperial senate by
the Purity Coalition.
Frontier developments sector wide remain theoretical, while corporate
interests are pushed through the red tape at record speed.
Corruption scandals that would once have felled whole governments, are
now barely given feed space in between the reality franchises of
the media conglomerates.
Human supremacist terrorists have delayed several federation
reconciliation talks, and continue to evade imperial security forces.
The disarmament of planet killer capable space hulks have been postponed,
seemingly indefinitely, by pirates and mobsters willing to exploit a
generation-long wish for peace,
and a new generation is turning out to be much less patient in the
name of the same peace than their veteran grandparents; as small border
conflicts only ever seem to be able to grow and escalate,
opening up old wounds.

There are also rumors that in the furthest backrooms of the imperial senate,
certain senators are discussing the merits of a new emperox.

Yes, it is truly a time to be alive,
              for the past has brought miracles from ashes;
                             and who knows just how bright the future will burn.
