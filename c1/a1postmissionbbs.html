1. Hyper-bike racing results
HansGG_7
    I know some of you don't have AURORA access out here, so here are the
    results of the race on Naja this last friday:

    1st - Niki Sokolov
    2nd - Deathrider
    3rd - Gloria Ferrari
    4th - Timo Glehn
    5th - Sarah Scholl
    6th - Oscar Azar

    Suprise take by Niki!
    Honestly can't believe deathrider managed to recover
    to second after the fall.

OblaJesta
    Woo! I knew Sokolov could do it! Pandais PRIDE!

Stanklord4
    YES! I HAD 200 CREDITS ON THE NEWCOMMER! WOO!

xLOLKATx
    Deathrider is cringe

LocustBill
    Niki should be looking over his shoulder, Deathrider don't fuck around.

    Go Timo!

2. MASSIVE ViDOLL LEAK!!!
SaturnHead22
    Apparently Gen 6 is going to be launched with synth bodies!
    FINALLY OUR GIRLS ARE GOING TO BE REAL GIRLS!!!
    I wonder if they are going to give Maiko chan a body too,
    they cant retire her just because she is a 3rd gen we will riot!

LocustBill
    Get this idol bullshit out of here, nobody cares
    They are robots not real people

SaturnHead22
    NO! MEAN! 

OblaJesta
    Going to state the obvious here, Maiko Saturn was way past her expiration
    date LAST GENERATION. They are only keeping her on life support because
    her fans (you) are stupid enough to buy the (cheaply made) merch.

SaturnHead22
    AS IF JESTA IS ANY BETTER YOU CLOWN LOVER!

Cayt
    Stop messaging me asking to ban ViDoll posts, I'm not going to.

3. AUSTRALIALIS NEWS CAST: Son of Imperial senator abducted.
NightRunner
    "Individuals close to the source reveal that
    Elijah ibn Ari Fatima bint Escudero, prince of the Escudero clan
    and grandson of current Imperial Senator of Shan
    Sultana Ari Fatima bint Escudero has gone missing..."

    Apparently it happened last month - Do you think it's the Ring?

xLOLKATx
    Isn't it weird that no ransome has been posted?

TheyTookMyBAALS
    Apparently the family were not the ones to tip of the journalists.

yp7K6rpm
    Makes sense. They would not want the attention.

NightRunner
    Keeping an eye on this one, now that the media got it they might
    post a reward.
    Unless it's the Ring, they can keep him.

xLOLKATx
    Why do they have so fucking long names???

4. Alien artifact stolen by pirates?
SilverSamurai
    The media is not covering this, but i have a couple of friends over in
    Maja and they say its legit!

    Apparently an imperial transport was ambushed by pirates and the survivors
    made it to Megeno. They talked to a couple of my friends before
    SYGNET came and took them away!

LocustBill
    Yeah sure, because they would be transporting alien artifiacts through
    pirate space. Don't think so.

NeverWinter
    It's not an alien artifiact its a an alein-psyker-baby that is
    working with the Pirates! NOW THE PIRATES WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE FUTURE!

5. Novatech looking for mercs
Johnson
    I hear novatech is looking for mercs to run recovery on a failed 
    research expedition to Muro.
    Anyone interested?

NightRunner
    From what i hear Muro is pretty nasty. I'd give it a pass.
    Had to deal with some nasty creatures on Al-Owar some years back,
    not something i'd do over.

NeverWinter
    THEY WANT TO USE IT FOR EVIL!!!!!

Johnson
    Well my contact is insessant - speak up if you change your mind.

yp7K6rpm
    Not for me, I try to stay out of Allisto these days.
    Too much friction between NeoBionic and the church.

NeverWinter
    EVIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

7. Hey yall heard from the ISS Bravehawk?
Stanklord4
    Last i heard they were looking for the insurance fraud bounty thing
    on the ISS STARGAZER????

NightRunner
    MIA as far as I've been told.
    Last heard they were in the Maja system.

Stanklord4
    FUCK! Fucking engineer owes me 200 credits!

Johnson
    Contract is still open if anyone wants it - VNA insurance has a decent
    trackrecord when it comes to paying out.

8. Hey, anyone knows how to open encrypted files.
66_1337_66
    I have a file that is encrypted, but i forgot the password.

LocustBill
    If it was important you should not have lost the password.
    take it to a professional, this is no place to ask for encryption cracking

9. Hey, my dad was was wondering if any
OblaJesta
    He doesn't know how to use BBSs, but he was wondering if anyone on
    here would be able to ship him some parts we need for the harvest?
    It's really hard to get anything on Pandais nowadays.

    If you can that would be a lifesaver!
