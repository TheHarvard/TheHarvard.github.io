      To Lina

      We knew it was going to be bad going in, but 
      you have no idea of what it is like here.

      We have recovered your sample. 
      It is unruly but the synths are keeping
      it under control.
      Weighs in around 200kg, no way we could
      have managed it without them.
      Finding it cost Rebecca her life.
      You have no idea of the things that
      exist here.

      We are preparing for extraction.
      I don't care that it is early, we have
      the sample and that is everything you need
      right?

      Come sunrise we will leave the station.
      I don't care if you allow it or not.
      We are leaving.

      Inada
