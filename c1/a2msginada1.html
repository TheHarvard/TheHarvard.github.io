      Hello everyone!

      I'm so glad to have you all on the team! 
      This mission is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity to 
      visit Muro and gather samples that have not been 
      seen since the silence!

      As you all already know, Muro is an incredibly
      dangerous planet, and we will do extensive
      base camp here on Kotris before leaving for her.
      But we will be under time pressure, and it
      will be stressfull. 
      The tide sweeps Muro every 47 days, and
      our facility will not be able to survive it
      so we will have to cram as much work into
      those 47 days as we can!

      In addition, we are going to have a
      "Prime Directive" on this mission.
      Novatech has been able to secure the
      funding of this trip to investigate a
      potential tribe of humans theorized
      to have been lost since the scream!
      So this will be our highest priority,
      but we'll be sure to fitt lots of 
      other work as well!

      Once it's all over I'll treat you all to a
      3 day corporate retreat here on Kotris!

      We are also lucky to have with us 3 of the latest
      generation technical personnel (read synths) from
      NeoBionic. 
      (Big thank you to our Neobionic rep for securing
      us a "family" discounted lease!)
      I know synths are a bit of a divisive topic at
      the moment, but in all the time i've spent with
      Gex I am fully convinced that they will be a 
      great asset to our mission!
      I have taken the liberty to nickname them
      something easier than the long serial numbers
      they come with, so say hello to Gex, Clue and
      Coffe!
      
      I've watched Muro my whole life from here on Kotris,
      and i would not want to explore it with any other
      team than this one!

      Shoot me a message when you are in system, and
      Marco and I will make sure to meet you at the 
      spaceport! 
      (He says hi too, by the way!)

          - Administrator Inada
