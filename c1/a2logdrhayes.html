=== ENTRY 1 ===

  Personal Log of Dr Rebecca Hayes concerning 
  NovaTech expedition to Muro in October of 3225.

  -

  We arrived at kotris today!

  Since i won't be doing much before we have made it to the base
  i figured i should keep a personal log! for posterity :)

  -

  The air is great here! 
  You would not believe it from the amount of stripmining
  that used to happen here.

  -

  Nic is cool, he's not very good at smalltalk
  but ask him about Earth/Xeno protein hybridization
  and he opens right up.
  Amélie is very friendly! but she also
  seems to be quite experienced.
  Was a bit worried she was going to be just 
  another corporate smile, but i think she is mostly geuine.
  Mark could not join us as much, he's from Kotris like Am
  and was very busy with technical prepp.

  Your loss Mark! We'll enjoy the teambuilding ;P

=== ENTRY 2 ===

  We have made planetfall!
  We've decided to reckon our time from the height of the
  Kotrisian tide, which makes today "day 5".

  Strange to think that the place i've spent the last 
  weeks is causing this whole tide.

  By our estimates we will need to be out of her by "day 40",
  so that gives rougly a month worth of research.

  It's going to be weird to work through the Muran "slow
  days", but i've never been to bothered with
  night shifts.

  Day 6
  The creatures here are really strange.
  Nic is in charge of the biology and all that,
  but even i can tell that they are strange.

  There are these 3-legged starfish like creatures
  near where we landed, Nic calls them "Treskellions".

  They swim around in the hotsprings there, but 
  nic says it's not actually water, or at least not
  drinkable.

  We've luckily brought all the provisions we need.

  Day 7
  The synths are really usefull.
  No way we could carry all this equipment without them!

  We should make it to the site tomorrow.
  That is, within the next 24 hours; it will still be dark.
  Apparently they flew the base frame in with some
  difficulty before the tide. I don't envy them that.
  This place is not for your average tourist!

  Day 9
  We have finally setteled in to the base.
  Took a while to get everything just so, I'm realizing
  why it was nessesary though.

  The synths negotiated the frame into place over the
  aperture, and I helped Mark with stretching the memebranes.
  It's kind of reassuring to have seen the primary
  and secondary membranes - otherwise i don't know
  if i would dare take my suit off.

  -

  Man the base air is a lot better than those
  horrid pressure tents!
  I have my own hammock, i can stretch - 
  This is great!

  Day 10

  Today is the first propper expedition.
  Finally i will be of use to the team! 
  I've been going over my supplies again and again
  since breakfast. 
  My heart is beating so fast!

  If we can find half of what we hope...

  But i won't be able to write any of it down here
  ofcourse, we have official NovaTech research 
  databases for that, so you'll have to wait 
  patiently for the publicantion ;)

  -

  Less than ideal results.
  
  Operation was called off - Nic found some tracks, 
  and the synths were all on egde.
  Kudos to Am for listening and aborting the op.
  It is a LOT colder down there, aparently 

  I'm dissapointed, of course. 
  But safety is priority.

  Am says we'll try again in a bit, currently
  the synths are mapping out the area, looking for
  more tracks.
  I hope they don't find any.

  Day 12
  
  at least nic is having a good time.
  I can't wait but he is sitting there with
  his coffe compiling notes on stuff.

  Says he has enough observations to
  write several papers, but i think he 
  just messing with me.
  Helps if you are a biologist i guess.

  Mark is fussing over corrosion of the support
  cables or something. Maybe i should ask if he
  needs any help.

  Day 13
  
  SO BORED!!!

  -

  Mark is pretty alright at chess.

=== ENTRY 9 ===

  Day 14
  
  Finally! 
  We have green light to try again! 

  One of the synths, "Coffe" i think, went down
  there and gathered some temperature readings
  and Nic was satisfied.
  Apparently what he is worried about is only
  active in the cold, and the sunlight has
  driven the temp up enough to be ok!

  Today is the day! 
  Today i will talk to ALIENS!!
