                               TOP SECRET // EYES ONLY

From: CLASSIFIED
OPERATION RAPTUROUS DOVE

This is a Zero-Support-Black operation.
Task Force operatives are activated upon receipt of this brief.

No assistance or recovery can be provided.

================================================================================

ASSIGNED ASSETS

Operative: Locke Richard, Pilot
Operative: Thorn Kyle, Security
Vessel: ISS METATRON
Mission Brief: This Brief

================================================================================

MISSION

    Infiltrate, Secure HVI, Exfiltrate to neutral system.

Operatives will be activated upon receipt of this brief.
Activation occurs 12 hours prior to SITE arrival, using cover as crew of
inbound space shuttle IMP EDELWEISS.
Arrival at SITE is scheduled 12 hours prior to Target Event.
Extraction of HVI must be completed within 24 hours, constrained by the
scheduled departure of IMP EDELWEISS, after which the shuttle will depart,
missing crew will be noticed, and operational cover will be compromised.

    HVI TARGET
Elijah ibn Ari Fatima bint Escudero - Noble-born, Institue Aspirant.
Survival is critical.
Target is to be extracted to neutral system for mission success.

    TARGET EVENT: 
HVI Graduation ceremony. Important ceremony with political ramifications.
Attendance important but non-critical; extraction remains primary objective.

    PRIMARY TASKS:
Establish communications with HVI and convey mission parameters.
If HVI noncompliant, physical extraction remains priority.
Exfiltrate HVI to Hangar B12; ISS METATRON prepositioned.
Ascend to orbit using vessel; transponder spoofing simulates shuttle EDELWEISS.
Maintain operational cover; minimize exposure of interstellar capabilities.

    OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS:
Planet populace unaware of human spacefaring capabilities
Avoid compromising planetary ignorance to mitigate disproportionate response.
Planetary governing authority secrecy reduces operational and political risk,
low impact operation will likely be actively covered up to our benefit.
Limited use of lethal force to will be tolerated and might be required.

================================================================================

THREAT ASSESSMENT:

SITE maintains elevated security posture; initial cover grants access,
but locating HVI requires bypassing internal security.

Site security: Small-arms armed personnel, with rapid-response teams on standby.
If operation goes hot, expect immediate escalation.

OPSEC is green.
Counter-elements assessed as low probability:

- Imperial College of Psykers
Will mobilize and attempt to lock down site if operation goes hot.

- Noble family of target
Distinguished by white desert kandura clothes.
Highly motivated to recover HVI, but politically constrained;
absence at Target Event expected

- Planetary authority
Typically absent at SITE; may be mobilized at Imperial College request.
Capable of deploying extensive and heavy forces, including anti-ship satellites.
Will resist system egress if vessel cover is compromised.
